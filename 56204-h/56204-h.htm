<h1>The Unspeakable Scot</h1>

<h2 id="I">I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SUPERSTITION</span></h2>

<p>This book is for Anglo-Saxons. It is also
in the nature of a broad hint for Scotchmen.
My qualification to bestow broad hints
upon the politest and most intellectual
of the peoples is that I possess a large fund
of contempt for the Scottish character. Also,
I had the misfortune to be born on a day
which is marked, sadly enough, in the calendars,
<span class="smcap">Burns died</span>. So that, one way and
another, I appear to have been raised up for
the work before us, even as Dr. J. M. Barrie<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
was raised up to assist the fortunes of a certain
brand of smoking mixture.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Of course, if a man speak of the Scotch in
any but the most dulcet tones he invites the
onslaught of a thousand witty pens. The
bare title of the present essay is pronounced
by good judges to be uncomplimentary to
Scotland, and I can well imagine that since
its announcement Drs. Lang, Archer, Robertson
Nicoll, Ross, and Hamish Hendry, together
with a base residuum of anonymous
reviewers, have made a point of sleeping in
their clothes in order that they might be
“ready, aye ready,” to deal faithfully with
the haughty Southron at the earliest possible
moment. I like to think, however, that Dr.
Lang, who, with true Scottish shrewdness,
avowed himself but yesterday a convinced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
crystal-gazer,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> has had due prevision of the
friendliness of my intentions. Were I disposed
to bloody battle, I might have opened
fire by remarking in hot type that if you
scratch a Scotchman you will find a very low
person indeed. Or I could have thrown from
my pompom that shining projectile:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">False Scot</div>
<div class="verse">Sold his king</div>
<div class="verse">For a groat.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But who, that has a feeling for warfare,
would fight with a Scotchman? Such a one,
I hope, does not breathe; the plain fact being
that if a Scot beats you, he beats you;
whereas, if you begin to beat a Scot, he will
assuredly bawl, in the King’s name, for the
law. “Hech, sirs, rin for the polis. Ah’m
gettin’ whupped!” Let us therefore continue
our discourse amicably.</p>

<p>Your proper child of Caledonia believes
in his bones that he is the salt of the
earth. Prompted by a glozing pride, not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
say by a black and consuming avarice, he
has proclaimed his saltiness from the house-tops
in and out of season, unblushingly,
assiduously, and with results which have no
doubt been most satisfactory from his own
point of view. There is nothing creditable to
the race of men, from filial piety to a pretty
taste in claret, which he has not sedulously
advertised as a virtue peculiar to himself.
This arrogation has served him passing well.
It has brought him into unrivalled esteem.
He is the one species of human animal that
is taken by all the world to be fifty per cent
cleverer and pluckier and honester than the
facts warrant. He is the daw with a peacock’s
tail of his own painting. He is the ass
who has been at pains to cultivate the convincing
roar of a lion. He is the fine gentleman
whose father toils with a muck-fork.
And, to have done with parable, he is
the clumsy lout from Tullietudlescleugh,
who, after a childhood of intimacy with the
crudest sort of poverty, and twelve months
at “the college” on moneys wrung from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
diet of his family,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> drops his threadbare kilt
and comes South in a slop suit to instruct the
English in the arts of civilisation and in the
English language. And because he is Scotch,
and the Scotch superstition is heavy on our
Southern lands, England will forthwith give
him a chance; for an English chance is his
birthright. Soon, forbye, shall he be living
in “chambers” and writing idiot books. Or
he shall swell and hector and fume in the
sub-editor’s room of a halfpenny paper. Or
a pompous and gravel-blind city house shall
grapple him to its soul in the capacity of confidential
clerk. Or he shall be cashier in a
jam factory, or “boo and boo” behind a
mercer’s counter, or “wait on” in a coffee
tavern, or, for that matter, soak away his
chapped spirit in the four-ale bars off Fleet
Street. Hence, as an elegant writer in one
of the weekly reviews puts it, the Englishman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
“is painfully aware that it is the Scot who
thrusts him aside in the contest for many of
the best prizes.”</p>

<p>When one turns to the intimate study of
the Scotch character as limned by Scotch
authority, one finds oneself confronted with
the work of two schools of artists, which, for
the sake of convenience, we will dub the Old
and New Schools. The Old School—of which,
by the way, every Scotchman save one is
either a member or a supporter—has had a
tremendous vogue and has accomplished
superhuman things for the country and
people of its love. To this school the Scotch
superstition owes its origin and its firm grip
on the imagination of the average white man.
It is a forthright, downright, thorough sort
of school, not in the least diffident or mealy-mouthed,
not in the least ambiguous, not in
the least infected with that “proud reserve”
which is understood to be Scotland’s noblest
heritage. Among the choice exemplars of
the art of the Old School—and it has thousands
of choice exemplars—we may reckon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Dr. George Lockhart, who wrote the <cite>Memoirs</cite>
and thereby earned for himself imperishable
fame. Lockhart was a “Scotland-for-ever”
man of the first water. “As for the [Scots],”
he says, “none will, I think, deny them to
have been a Brave, Generous, Hardy People.…
As the Scots were a Brave, so likewise
were they a Polite People; every
Country has its own peculiar Customs, and
so had Scotland, but in the main they lived
and were refined as other Countries; and
this won’t seem strange, for the English
themselves allow the Scots to be a Wise and
Ingenious People, for say they to a Proverb,
‘<i>They never knew a</i> Scots <i>Man a Fool</i>.’ And
if so, what should hinder them from being
as well bred and civilised as any other People?
Those of Rank (as they still do) travelled
Abroad into foreign Countries for their
Improvement, and vast numbers, when their
Country at home did not require their services
[mark the fine sophistry] went into that
of foreign Princes, from whence after they
had gained immortal Honour and Glory, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
returned home; and as it is obvious that at
this very time (which must chiefly proceed
from this humour of Travelling) the Scotch
Gentry do far exceed those of England, so
that in the one you shall find all the accomplishments
of well-bred gentleman, and
in your country English Esquires all the
Barbarity imaginable.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Thus Dr. George
Lockhart, two hundred years ago. ’Tis a
fair picture and a winning, if a trifle overstated.
There stands your brilliant, and at
the same time unassuming, figure of a Scotchman—“brave,”
“generous,” “hardy,” “polite,”
“refined,” “not a fool,” “well bred,”
“civilised,” “travelled,” “wise,” “ingenious,”
and immortally “honourable” and
“glorious.” Who can withstand him? Who
would deny him the look of love, the patriot
glow? Certainly not the men of his own
blood, who have their livings to get. Certainly
not the Scotchman, who perceives, by
favour of Dr. Lockhart, his own impeccable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sonsie self done to the life. To this day the
artists of the Old School continue to paint
the same inspiring portrait, and if you look
into the latest replica, by no less judicial a
hand than that of Dr. John Hill Burton<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
you shall discover the undying lineaments,
bespeaking the undying virtues, and composed
sweetly to the purposes of the undying
advertisement.</p>

<p>So much for the Old School. As for the
New School, I take credit that it is a discovery
of my own. It consists of one man
only. He is a Scotchman, and his name is
William Robertson Nicoll. Dr. Nicoll is the
editor of the <cite>British Weekly</cite>. He also edits
the <cite>Bookman</cite>, and lounges round letters in a
paper called the <cite>Sketch</cite>. Some time ago this
great and good Scotchman was accused of
indulging in too many literary aliases. We
were then informed by a <i lang="fr">protégé</i> of his that it
would be well for us to lift reverent eyes and
behold in Dr. William Robertson Nicoll “a
force in letters”—“the only force, some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
us think,” added the incense-breathing <i lang="fr">protégé</i>.
We looked and beheld. Also we read,
in <cite>Who’s Who</cite>, that Dr. Nicoll was the author
of <cite>The Lamb of God</cite>, <cite>The Key of the Grave</cite>,
<cite>The Incarnate Saviour</cite>, <cite>The Return to the
Cross</cite>, <cite>The Secret of Christian Experience</cite>,
<cite>Songs of Rest</cite>, and <cite>Sunday Afternoon Verses</cite>,
all, no doubt, excellent and exciting works,
but obviously sealed to a department of
letters in which we have not specialised.
Therefore, we took “the-force-in-letters”
notion for granted. Our own idea of Dr.
Robertson Nicoll’s relation to letters will be
set forth duly in another chapter. Meanwhile,
it is necessary to say that Dr. Nicoll
is one of those delightfully irresponsible
literary forces who babble of “Mr. S. R.
Crockett’s <em>great</em> novel <cite>Joan of the Sword
Hand</cite>,” in one breath, and with the next
pray to be delivered from “a misuse of
words.”</p>

<p>But let us give honour where honour is due.
There are white marks even on the editor of
the <cite>British Weekly</cite>. For quite two years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
past his dropsical pennyworth has been our
constant solace in times of darkness and difficulty.
Each week it contains a lengthy
and helpful letter by one “Claudius Clear.”
Many young Scotch writers have told us in
many a useful paragraph that they do not
think they are breaking a confidence when
they say that “Claudius Clear” is one of the
pen names of Dr. Robertson Nicoll. So that
on the whole “Claudius” is a Scotchman,
despite the circumstance that he dates his
correspondence from Basil Regis, Middlesex,
and masquerades in a name which is about as
Scotch as “Schiepan.” For that matter, anybody
might have guessed it from his syntax.
And being a Scotchman, “Claudius” is, of
course, omniscient and infallible. That is
where the absurd beauty of him comes in.
That, Messrs. Hodder and Stoughton, is why
one reads the <cite>British Weekly</cite>. Do you wish
to know how to run the <cite>Times</cite>? Would you
care to be instructed in “the art of conversation”?
Are you anxious to learn what is
really meant by “good manners”? Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
you be advised on “Order and Method,”
“Brilliance,” “Overwork,” “Handwriting,”
“Publishing as a Profession,” “Editing as a
Profession,” “The Keeping of Old Letters,”
“How to Remember and how to Forget,”
“The Art of Life,” “The Art of Taking things
Coolly,” “Turning Out the Fools,” or indeed
on any other matter under the sun—from
“Vanity” to “Samuel”?—why, you just turn
up “Claudius,” and there you are; two
columns which settle the question swiftly
and for ever. What wonder, then, that in
my anxiety to get at the truth about Scotchmen,
I should turn up “Claudius”? Nor
have I turned him up in vain, as witness the
following admirable words:</p>

<p>“In the first place, the Scotsman is a son
of the rock. The circumstances of his birth
and upbringing are as a rule very stern. He
is cradled in the storm; he has to fight for
life in a rough climate, in a huddle of grey
houses. The amenities of life are by no
means plentiful. As a rule, money is scarce.
There are few demonstrations of affection;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
one is made to feel that he must trust himself,
that man is a soldier, and life is a fight.
[Here, Scot-like, the worthy “Claudius”
breaks off to indulge in a little pathetic
personal reminiscence.] When I look back
to my early years it seems to me that the
whole atmosphere was laden with care, that
the strain on the hearts of the people was so
tightened by the material needs of those who
depended on them that life was a taut rope
on which only a trained acrobat could keep
his balance. The result was a feeling of
constant anxiety, a dread of the future. It
was haunted by fears which could hardly
be measured, and as the years went on their
difficulties seemed to increase. [Which, to
say the least, is clumsily put.] In this way
young Scotsmen were taught to take things
seriously. They knew that their right arms
must serve them, and they did not lean upon
others. They were thus fiercely independent.
They asked nothing from those about
them—the asking would be vain. As they
sought nothing they would give nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Acknowledgment of superior position they
resolutely refused; and they were ready to
resent every assumption of superiority. They
knew well that the door of opportunity opens
but seldom, and were eager to enter it when
it did open. They knew that success in any
form was to be paid for, and they were willing
to pay. They would work hard without
complaining, and they were willing to sacrifice,
and ever came to disdain the pleasures
and amusements of life. They had been
taught that it was of no use to complain, and
they did not complain. But they made
amends for this by refusing to be gracious, by
a reserved and proud manner. They knew
that competition was the law of life, and
they were none too gentle in dealing with
their competitors. Those who achieved
positions were objects of criticism, and the
criticism was pitiless enough. For a fight
they were in constant readiness. ‘Touch me
gin you daur,’ was the national motto, and
there never was one more expressive of
character. The Scotsman as a rule does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
take the offensive, but those who meddle
with him must take all the consequences.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Clearly, as one might say, a Daniel come
to judgment! “Claudius Clear,” the New
School, struts and roisters and swaggers as
your Scot must do, or perish; but, on the
whole and out of the honesty of his heart,
he will modify. Perhaps he was not in the
best of humours when he wrote the foregoing.
Anyway it rather disposes of the gallant and
debonair vision conjured up for us by the
glowing pencils of the Old School. The
generous, polite, refined, well-bred, civilised,
and immortally honourable and glorious
Scotchman of Dr. George Lockhart becomes,
under the brush of Dr. Robertson Nicoll,
another and a distinctly less beautiful personality.
He is born on the rock. The amenities
of life are not for him. He is haunted
by constant fears. He will give nothing.
He refuses to be gracious. He is none too
gentle in dealing with his competitors. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
instead of saying “<i lang="la">Nemo me impune lacesset</i>,”
as you might expect of a young man
who has been to college, he whoops “Touch
me gin you daur,” like any common rowdy.
When I come to think of it, I am much
obliged to the New School.</p>

<p>On another matter—a very big matter,
indeed, with your common Scotchman—Dr.
Nicoll is equally frank. “I think I may also
say,” he remarks, “that the Scottish people
cared very much for education and knowledge,
far more in my opinion than the
average Englishman. They thought about
learning as the New Englanders did in the
days of Emerson. The learned man was
much more respected than the rich man.
Perhaps there was an intuition that in the
end of the day knowledge is the key to
everything. But thirty years ago, at all
events, knowledge was regarded as an end,
and its possessor was profoundly esteemed.
The <i lang="la">summum bonum</i><a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of the best Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
youth in those days was to be a professor.”
<i lang="la">Summum bonum</i> is scarcely the
phrase, but that and the New Englanders
may pass. Scotland, admittedly, enjoys a
reputation for learning of a sort. Once,
I visited Edinburgh with a Scotchman. It
was a rash thing to do, yet I did it. On
the road north my Scotchman filled me
with tales of his country’s culture. “You
are not going into a dirty English city,”
quoth he, “but into a centre of light and
leading. Every man, woman, and child
in ‘aud Immemour’ can at least read, and
every publican in the place keeps a set of
<cite>Chambers’s Encyclopædia</cite>, a copy of Fox’s
<cite>Book of Martyrs</cite>, and plenty of back numbers
of the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>, just as an English
publican keeps for the use of his customers
the <cite>Post Office Directory</cite> and <cite>Whitaker’s Almanack</cite>.”
And the first thing I noticed when
we got into Edinburgh was a fruiterer’s sign,
upon which was written in startling letters:</p>

<p class="center">FRUITS IN THERE SEASON</p>

<p>All the same, I concede that the Scotch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
really do love learning. I gather, too, from
unbiassed sources that they starve their
mothers and make gin-mules of their fathers
to get it. And when it is gotten, what a
monstrous and unlovely possession it usually
turns out to be. For your Scotchman always
takes knowledge for wisdom. His learning
consists wholly of “facts and figures,” all
grouped methodically round that heaven-sent
date, <span class="smcapuc">A.D.</span> 1314,<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and if you cannot tell him
off-hand the salary of the Archbishop of
Canterbury, the population of Otaheite and
the names of the fixed stars, he votes you a
damned ignorant Southron, and goes about
telling his friends that he shouldn’t wonder
if you never went to “the schule.” It may
rejoice him to know that his readiness to
answer all manner of questions involving
book learning is in point of fact the beginnings
of a species of idiocy. Persons of
whom this idiocy has got properly hold are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
styled by the medical profession “idiot
<i lang="fr">savants</i>.” “In all asylums,” says Professor
Vivian Poore, “you will find idiot <i lang="fr">savants</i>.…
There used to be at Earlswood—and
I saw him when I visited Earlswood—an
idiot quite incapable of taking care of
himself, but who had a most extraordinary
memory. When I went to the asylum the
superintendent said to me: ‘Ask that man
anything you like.’ It was rather a strange
thing to be told to do; I said: ‘What kind of
thing shall I ask about?’ And he said: ‘Any
ordinary bit of knowledge.’ I said: ‘Tell me
about Socrates.’ The idiot then drew himself
up like a child would who was about to
repeat a lesson, gave a cough, and told me
about Socrates.… He knew a great
deal more about Socrates than I did; he
knew when he was born, why he was condemned,
the name of his wife, and everything
that was essential to be known. This he repeated
without difficulty. The superintendent
gave a grin and said: ‘Would you like to
ask him anything else?’ I was afraid that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the man might ask me something. I said:
‘What do you know about comets?’ Immediately
he gave me—I presume correctly—all
the facts about the chief comets, their
periods of revolution, the names of the best
known, and so on. Nothing that had ever
been read by this patient did he seem to forget.
The words which had been read to
him seemed to have stuck to the cells of his
brain like so much superior glue, and nothing
would eradicate it.”<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>How very, very, very Scotch! Who has
not met just this idiot <i lang="fr">savant</i> in a newspaper
office, at the meetings of absurd societies, at
the houses of uncultivated people? And
always, always, he is Scotch. And always,
always, he has that sententious trick of
drawing himself up to launching into his
subject by way of the self-satisfied cough of
conscious knowledge.</p>

<span class="smaller">PREDECESSORS</span></h2>

<p>From the day he first clapped eyes on him,
the Englishman has felt that there was something
wrong about the Scotchman. And
this feeling rapidly crystallised itself into literature.
Many early ballads against the
Scotch are to be found by him who cares to
look for them. That Chaucer did not love
Scotchmen is pretty certain, though there is
nothing in his writings to prove it. The
same holds true of Spenser. But when one
comes to Shakespeare the case is very much
altered. There can be no getting away from
the circumstance that Shakespeare knew his
Scotchman through and through. Any Scot
who is feeling a desire to be particularly
humble and to learn the real truth about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
himself and his compatriots should read and
read again the tragedy of <cite>Macbeth</cite>. Of course,
Shakespeare does not count much in Scotland.
Whenever a Scottish writer of the old
school has to speak of him, he does so with a
grumbling grudgingness as who should say,
“The man was a genius, but not a Scot, what
a peety!”</p>

<p>“Here Douglas forms wild Shakespeare
into plant,” warbled Burns. Think of it!
And I have seen a Scotch reviewer complain
that a certain author was cursed with a
“Shakespearean smartness.” This antipathy
for the Bard of Avon has often created
much wonderment in the mind of the Englishman,
and the cause of it, one may guess,
is that Shakespeare wrote <cite>Macbeth</cite>. There is
scarcely a line in that tremendous drama
which does not mean bitter reading for
Scotchmen. About the first person named
is one Macdonwald:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The merciless Macdonwald</div>
<div class="verse">Worthy to be a rebel for to that,</div>

<div class="verse">Do swarm upon him.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>In a neighbouring passage we are given a
beautiful insight into Scottish views of warfare.
Ross is made to say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Sweno the Norway’s King craves composition,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor would we deign him burial of his men</div>
<div class="verse">Till he disbursed at Saint Colmes’ inch</div>
<div class="verse">Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ten thousand dollars to our general use”!
From the beginning of time Scotch fighting
men have been mercenaries, and Scotch
armies have insisted upon fining a vanquished
foe. They did it in France; and they did it
in their own country. And, after Naseby,
the Scotch army in England, coming to the
conclusion that there was nothing more to be
done, straightway demanded a sum of money
in the way of solatium for leaving the country.
“Nor would we deign him burial of his
men till he disbursed,” hits them hard.
Shakespeare, as was his way, understood.
Then one comes to the celebrated scene on
the blasted heath. Here enter three witches,
and to them Macbeth and Banquo. Macbeth,
bloated with pride and devoured with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
ambition, falls an easy victim to Shakespeare’s
trinity of hags.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!</div>
<div class="verse">All hail, Macbeth! Hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!</div>
<div class="verse">All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The man swells visibly as a Scotchman
should, and stalks off heroically, full of the
consciousness of his own bigness. And mark
how arrant a Scotchman he becomes in the
result. In his castle he has for guest a king
who has trusted him and bestowed honours
and dignities upon him. “Conduct me to
mine host,” says the unsuspecting monarch.
“We love him highly, and shall continue our
graces towards him.” And all the time the
excellent Macbeth and his excellent lady are
plotting murder. When it comes to the
point of actual killing, the gentleman’s
Scotch spirits fail him; he is really not sure,
don’t you know, whether after all it ought to
be done. Then the lady very naturally
grows disgusted and shrill:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent12">Was the hope drunk,</div>
<div class="verse">Wherein you dress’d yourself? hath it slept since?</div>
<div class="verse">And wakes it now to look so green and pale</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<div class="verse">At what it did so freely? From this time,</div>
<div class="verse">Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard</div>
<div class="verse">To be the same in thine own act and valour,</div>
<div class="verse">As thou art in desire? Would’st thou have that</div>
<div class="verse">Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life,</div>
<div class="verse">And live a coward in thine own esteem;</div>
<div class="verse">Letting I dare not wait upon I would,</div>
<div class="verse">Like the poor cat i’ the adage?</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And what a deliciously smug Scotch answer
is immediately forthcoming! Says the
faint-hearted traitor:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">I dare all that may become a man;</div>
<div class="verse">Who dares do more, is none.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here we have the moralising scoundrel in
which Scotland is so prolific turned out to the
life. Right through the play Shakespeare
pitilessly holds up to our gaze the low and
squalid cunning, treachery, the hypocrisy,
and the devilry which have always been and
always will be at the bottom of the Scotchman’s
soul, and Macduff puts the coping
stone on the structure of opprobrium by calling
his countryman a hell-hound and a bloodier
villain than terms can give him out, and
assuring him that he will live to be the show
and gaze o’ the time:</p>

<div class="verse">Painted upon a pole and underwrit,</div>
<div class="verse">Here may you see the tyrant.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>From Shakespeare it is an easy jump to
Jonson, who helped to write a play which
put the Scot in such bad plight that it had to
be suppressed by the authorities. Then, of
course, there is Samuel Johnson, LL.D., who
hated the Scotch at large and by instinct.
Johnson has enjoyed no little reputation for
his animadversions upon Scotland. In bulk
they are slight, but they are decidedly to the
point. Boswell treasured them and put
them into his book, and to Johnson was the
glory. Boswell, it is true, was a Scotchman
himself, and the fact that he has given us one
of the most entertaining pieces of biography
ever written is allowed to redound to the
credit of Scotland. I never read the life,
however, without feeling that Johnson must
have written Boswell and that Boswell wrote
Johnson’s poems.</p>

<p>The next good hater of your Scotchman is
Charles Lamb. Lamb, need one say, was
Lamby, even in his hatreds. He had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gentle heart and he never exerted himself to
put down aught in malice, so that he called
his feelings of contempt for Scotchmen an
imperfect sympathy, and this is what he
wrote:</p>

<p>“I have been trying all my life to like
Scotchmen, and am obliged to desist from
the experiment in despair. They cannot like
me—and, in truth, I never knew one of that
nation who attempted to do it. There is
something more plain and ingenuous in their
mode of proceeding. We know one another
at first sight. There is an order of imperfect
intellects (under which mine must be content
to rank) which in its constitution is essentially
anti-Caledonian. The owners of the
sort of faculties I allude to have minds rather
suggestive than comprehensive. They have
no pretences to much clearness or precision in
their ideas or in their manner of expressing
them. Their intellectual wardrobe (to confess
fairly) has few whole pieces in it. They
are content with fragments and scattered
pieces of truth. She presents no full front to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
them—a feature or side-face at the most.
Hints and glimpses, germs and crude essays
at a system, are the utmost they pretend to.
They beat up a little game peradventure—and
leave it to knottier heads, more robust
constitutions, to run it down. The light that
lights them is not steady and polar, but mutable
and shifting; waxing, and again waning.
Their conversation is accordingly. They will
throw out a random word in or out of season,
and be content to let it pass for what it is
worth. They cannot speak always as if they
were upon their oath—but must be understood,
speaking or writing, with some abatement.
They seldom wait to mature a proposition,
but e’en bring it to market in the
green ear. They delight to impart their defective
discoveries as they arise, without
waiting for their full development. They
are no systematisers, and would but err more
by attempting it. Their minds, as I said
before, are suggestive merely. The brain of
a true Caledonian (if I am not mistaken) is
constituted upon quite a different plan. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Minerva is born in panoply. You are never
admitted to see his ideas in their growth—if,
indeed, they do grow, and are not rather put
together upon principles of clock-work. You
never catch his mind in an undress. He
never hints or suggests anything, but unlades
his stock of ideas in perfect order and completeness.
He brings his total wealth into
company and gravely unpacks it. His riches
are always about him. He never stoops to
catch a glimmering something in your presence,
to share it with you, before he quite
knows whether it be true touch or not. You
cannot cry <em>halves</em> to anything that he finds.
He does not find, but bring. You never witness
his first apprehension of a thing. His
understanding is always at its meridian—you
never see the first dawn, the early streaks.
He has no falterings of self-suspicion. Surmises,
guesses, misgivings, half-intuitions,
semi-consciousness, partial illuminations,
dim instincts, embryo conceptions, have no
place in his brain or vocabulary. The twilight
of dubiety never falls upon him. Is he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
orthodox?—he has no doubts. Is he an infidel?—he
has none either. Between the
affirmative and the negative there is no border
land with him. You cannot hover with
him upon the confines of truth, or wander in
the maze of a probable argument. He always
keeps the path. You cannot make
excursions with him, for he sets you right.
His taste never fluctuates. His morality
never abates. He cannot compromise or
understand middle actions. There can be
but a right and a wrong. His conversation
is as a book. His affirmations have the sanctity
of an oath. You must speak upon the
square with him. He stops a metaphor like
a suspected person in an enemy’s country.
‘A healthy book!’ said one of his countrymen
to me, who had ventured to give that
appellation to John Buncle—‘did I catch
rightly what you said? I have heard of a
man in health and of a healthy state of body,
but I do not see how that epithet can be
properly applied to a book.’ Above all, you
must beware of indirect expressions before a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Caledonian. Clap an extinguisher upon your
irony, if you are unhappily blest with a vein
of it. Remember you are upon your oath.
I have a print of a graceful female after
Leonardo da Vinci, which I was showing off
to Mr. ⸺. After he had examined it minutely,
I ventured to ask him how he liked
‘my beauty’ (a foolish name it goes by
among my friends)—when he very gravely assured
me that ‘he had considerable respect for
my character and talents’ (so he was pleased
to say), ‘but had not given himself much
thought about the degree of my personal
pretensions.’ The misconception staggered
me, but did not seem much to disconcert
him. Persons of this nation are particularly
fond of affirming a truth—which nobody
doubts. They do not so properly affirm as
annunciate it. They do, indeed, appear to
have such a love of truth (as if, like virtue, it
were valuable for itself) that all truth becomes
equally valuable, whether the proposition
that contains it be new or old, disputed,
or such as is impossible to become a subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
of disputation. I was present not long since
at a party of North Britons, where a son of
Burns was expected; and happened to drop
a silly expression (in my South British way),
that I wished it were the father instead of
the son, when four of them started up at once
to inform me that ‘that was impossible, because
he was dead.’ An impracticable wish,
it seems, was more than they could conceive.
Swift has hit off this part of their character,
namely, their love of truth, in his biting way,
but with an illiberality that necessarily confines
the passage to the margin.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>“The tediousness of these people is certainly
provoking. I wonder if they ever tire one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
another! In my early life I had a passionate
fondness for the poetry of Burns. I have
sometimes foolishly hoped to ingratiate myself
with his countrymen by expressing it.
But I have always found that a true Scot
resents your admiration of his compatriot,
even more than he would your contempt of
him. The latter he imputes to your ‘imperfect
acquaintance with many of the words
which he uses’; and the same objection makes
it a presumption in you to suppose that you
can admire him. Thomson they seem to
have forgotten. Smollett they have neither
forgotten nor forgiven for his delineation of
Rory and his companion upon their first introduction
to our metropolis. Speak of
Smollett as a great genius, and they will retort
upon you Hume’s <cite>History</cite> compared
with <em>his</em> continuation of it. What if the historian
had continued <cite>Humphrey Clinker</cite>?”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>I reproduce this estimate with the utmost
satisfaction. The irony of the “imperfect
intellects” passage will not be understood by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
dull Donald; indeed, he will in all probability
take the passage seriously and quote it
against me, but he is welcome. And on the
whole I think that Lamb’s view of the Scot is
almost as acute as that of Dr. Robertson
Nicoll himself. Nobody can doubt after
reading the foregoing that Lamb saw in the
Scotchman a crass and plantigrade person,
incapable of comprehending the inexplicit
and as devoid of true imagination as a brick.
Lamb’s notion of the Scot’s incapacity for
humour also chimes with that of Sidney
Smith, who, as all men know, was of opinion
that if you would have a Scotchman see a
joke it is necessary to perform a surgical
operation on him.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Last of all, though perhaps brightest and
best of them, who have lifted up their voices
in the unmasking of the Scot, we must take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Mr. W. E. Henley. In an entirely just and
reasonable essay on Burns, Mr. Henley made
a passing reference to the poor living, lewd,
grimy, free-spoken, ribald old Scots peasant-world.
For this choice collocation of adjectives
he was rewarded with many Scottish
thwacks. That the old Scots peasant-world
was everything that Mr. Henley said of it no
person of sense will gainsay, and that the Scots
peasant-world of to-day is, if anything, worse,
is evident from the remark of one of Mr.
Henley’s Scottish critics, who says:</p>

<p>“We challenge Mr. Henley, <i lang="la">et hoc genus
omne</i>, to disprove the fact that the record of
crime, immorality, loose living in every parish
wherein Burns resided, shows less by one
half—by fifty to seventy per cent.—in
that Burns epoch than it does in the same
parishes to-day.”</p>

<p>Mr. Henley has brought such a swarm of
bees round his bonnet by a simple and quite
tolerant bit of criticism, that to venture on
anything in the way of plain talk about the
Scotch might well appal the stoutest. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
worthy Dr. John D. Ross, editor of the <cite>Burns
Almanac</cite> and sundry other compilations of a
fatuously Burnsite character, has collected
some of the diatribes against Mr. Henley into
a volume which he calls <cite>Henley and Burns</cite>.
Like everything else that comes out of Scotland,
this volume gives the Scotchman away
at all points. For example, it is made quite
plain that Mr. Henley’s essay, a purely critical
venture, was regarded in Scotland as a base
attempt to pull down the cash value of early
editions of Burns’s poetry. Dr. Ross’s volume
opens with the following oracular sentence:
“Lovers of Burns will rejoice to learn
from the large price paid this week for a Kilmarnock
edition, that despite the criticism of
Mr. W. E. Henley in the Centenary edition,
there are as yet no signs that the poet’s popularity
is on the wane,” and this brilliant
commercialist adds: “Rightly or wrongly,
Scotsmen will cling to the Burns’ superstition,
and will be the better for it. At an important
book sale in Edinburgh this week, a Kilmarnock
first edition in an apparently perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
state of preservation, fetched the remarkable
price of 545 guineas. The highest price ever
before given for a copy of this edition, mutilated,
however, and in inferior condition, was
£120. Such a figure is undoubtedly a fancy
price. The book is very rare, and to the
bibliophile rarity is an all-important consideration
in estimating value. But the popularity
of the poet, the admiration of the
uncritical, as Mr. Henley would put it, has
helped to magnify the price of the book, and
the critic’s depreciation has had no effect on
the market.” What in the name of all that
is Burnsy does this gentleman mean?</p>

<p>Again, in another paper headed “A Critic
Scarified,” the scarifier takes Mr. Henley to
task for saying that “the Scots peasant …
fed so cheaply that even on high days and
holidays his diet (as set forth in the <cite>Blithsome
Bridal</cite>) consisted largely in preparations
of meal and vegetables and what is technically
known as ‘offal.’” To which Dr. Ross’s
scarifier retorts, “The author is happily
addressing ignorant Southrons, not even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
‘half-read’ Scots. However, it need not be
imagined that Mr. Henley can translate the
Scots language of the poem he refers to, else he
would not assert that the viands specified in
it are such common fare, consisting as they
did of six different soups, eight varieties of
fish (including shell-fish), six varieties of
flesh (roasts, salted meat, nolt feet, haggis,
tripe, sheep’s head), three kinds of bread
(oaten, barley, and wheaten), cheese, new
ale, and brandy.” On the face of it there is
here a mighty deal of offal to precious little
sound meat. If nolt feet, haggis, tripe, and
sheep’s head are not offal in Scotland, they
are certainly reckoned in that category in
England.</p>

<p>We shall return to Dr. Ross’s scarifier in a
chapter on “The Bard.” Meanwhile, let us
note that the best English writers have agreed
that the Scotchman is, at best, not quite an
angel of light. They have looked on him
with the eye of calm perception, and they
have found him seriously wanting. That he
is a savage and a barbarian by blood, a freebooter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
by heredity, a dullard, a braggart, and
in short, a Scotchman, cannot be doubted.
The testimony is all against him, and until
he mends his ways it will continue to be
against him.</p>

<h2 id="III">III<br />
<span class="smaller">THE POW-WOW MEN</span></h2>

<p>It is the Scotchman’s boast that the
Scotchman has always figured portentously
in the councils of the civilised nations. In
France, in Germany, and even in unbeautiful
Russia, Scotchmen have established themselves
and at time and time risen to positions
of considerable political power. And if we
are to credit Dr. Hill Burton, this has always
been an excellent thing for the nations concerned.
According to Dr. Burton, if the
Scotch did not entirely build up the France
of the Middle Ages they had a mighty big
finger in the process, and we are asked to
believe by the same authority that it is the
strain of Scotch blood in the veins of the
French which has assisted very materially in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
making the fortunes of that singularly fascinating
and ingenious people.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The subject
is a large one, and much that is edifying has
been written about it, not only by Scotchmen,
but by various foreign authors. On the
whole, perhaps, Europe has not done so
badly with her Scots, the reason being that
she never allowed them to be any Scotcher
than she could help, and turned them out the
minute they became aggressive. In England,
however, the more Scotch and the more
aggressive the Scot becomes the more we
seem to like him. At the present moment
England is virtually being run by the Scotch.
In the House of Commons the Leader of the
Government—and practically the autocrat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the Assembly—is the Right Honourable
Arthur James Balfour, a philosopher from
Scotland, who is so Scotch that he plays golf.
And the Leader of the Opposition, save the
mark! of an Opposition which, in a constitution
like the British, carries upon its shoulders
the heaviest responsibilities, is Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman, also a Scotchman, and
if the truth must be told, a dullard. And in
the way of a third party, which will imperialise
with the Government and cackle of reform
with the Opposition, we have the Liberal
Leaguers, headed by that proud chieftain of
the pudding race—the Right Honourable the
Earl of Rosebery. So that at the front of
each of the three great political forces of
Britain—the forces which, when all is said,
mean everything to Britain as a nation—there
stands firm and erect some sort of a
Caledonian. Such a condition of things has
never existed in England before, and in the
light of recent political happenings it is devoutly
to be hoped that it will never exist
again. Since Mr. Balfour and Sir Henry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Campbell-Bannerman came into the offices
they hold, England has been going steadily
down-hill. At no period in her history have
her enemies been so thick on the ground and
so exultant and sure of themselves as they are
at present, and at no period in her history has
her prestige been at so low an ebb. Politically
she has come to count as a little less than
France and more than Spain. Formerly she
led the nations—now she is content to walk
humbly in line with them. Formerly she
led the band, now she is merely third trombone
player. Formerly, if she went to war,
it was with nations of ponderability and for
high principles; until the other day, she was
draining her best blood and getting rid of
one and a half millions of money weekly in
a struggle with a handful of freebooters, got
up and fomented largely in the interests of
the children of Israel. At the time of writing
Consols are at 94 and the Income Tax is 1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>
in the pound, which shows what managers
the Scotch are. Also Government, in so far as
Government means the steady development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of the higher interests of the state at home
and in the colonies, is at a dead standstill.
The march of reform has been checked.
Progress in the wide sense of the term is no
more thought of. The legislative mill grinds
heavily along and the grist amounts to nothing;
in the seats of the mighty,—in the seats
of Benjamin Disraeli and William Ewart
Gladstone,—there blandly smiles Balfour and
dodders Campbell-Bannerman. Mr. Balfour,
golfer, and, for aught I know to the contrary,
curler and hammer-putter, plays what he is
pleased to call the game. Now the game is
no new thing. Practically it is a development
of that childish pastime known as “Jack’s
on his Island.” On Mr. Balfour’s island
grows the green bay tree of power, and to live
snugly under the shade of that tree, no matter
what comes, is, in the view of Mr. Balfour,
the game. It is with him a question of
what can I do for England, having due
regard to the exigencies of the game?
Hence does he seek and bring along young
talent. Having found your young talent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
you must make quite sure, not of its talentedness,
but of its unwavering disposition to
play the game. Will it be loyal to the Balfour?
Can you depend upon it to stick by
the Balfour though the heavens fall and it
thunder to the tune of Green Sleeves? Anything
that will subscribe to the Test Act of
the Balfour is young talent. Hence it comes
to pass that at the War Office we have had
that shallow, dandy Wyndham. He is a
<i lang="fr">protégé</i> of the Balfour, even as the Balfour is
the nephew of his uncle. And he plays the
game. When matters at the War Office became
too vasty for him he was shovelled by
the Balfour into the Chief Secretaryship for
Ireland. Even the Balfour and his friends
are fain to admit that Mr. Wyndham has
done no more for Ireland than he did for the
War Office. Yet he plays the game, and so
does the Balfour, and everything is right as
right can be. In Mr. Wyndham’s old place
at the War Office we have that excellent dabbler,
Mr. Brodrick. Mr. Brodrick, like the
House of Lords, has always been exceedingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
busy doing nothing and doing it very well.
Periodically he stands on his hind legs in the
Commons and trots out tremendous schemes,
all of which end pleasantly in smoke. The
rottenness of the British Army is no affair of
his; it was rotten when he first made its acquaintance—it
will be just as rotten when he
leaves Pall Mall. Underneath the terrific
expenditure necessitated by the war there
are jobs and scandals of the gravest sort, and
Mr. Brodrick knows nothing about them.
His business is to vindicate the characters of
fribbling officers and gentlemen, to lay on
praise of the British soldier with a trowel,
and to assure the world at large that the persons
who have brought charges against army
contractors have brought those charges simply
because the contractors’ names are un-English
and consequently not pleasing to the
British commercial mind. He it is, in short,
who allows himself to be put up as a sort
of sand-bag in front of the Government,
guaranteed to ward off all attacks by simply
sitting tight and remaining as dumb as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
oyster. He was no doubt told when
he took up his present dignities that the
Balfour would expect him to play the
game, and, being a good man, he is playing
it.</p>

<p>For the rest of them one man only needs
be discussed. He is a Birmingham man,
Joseph Chamberlain by name. The Balfour
took him over from the other side, and, in
spite of all his faults, gave him a warm Scotch
welcome and set him high in the Balfourian
councils. From that day to this the Balfour
has looked upon him askance and wished him
anywhere but where he is; but the Balfour
is Scotch and he lacks the pluck to get rid of
the Birmingham gentleman, because it might
cost them something. The Birmingham gentleman,
knowing the Balfour to be Scotch,
defies him.</p>

<p>On the other side, as we have said, there
is poor, dear old Sir ’Enry of the double-barrelled
Scotch name, which the economical
have reduced to C.-B. On the whole, C.-B.
is about as pathetic a figure as one can find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in history; he is the type and flower of your
Scotchman lifted to the pinnacles. Sooner
or later he was bound to make a mess of it,
and, lacking the blood of Liverpool which delayed
Mr. Gladstone’s downfall for so many
years, he made it sooner. From the first he
has been the laughing-stock, not only of the
Government, and, for that matter, of Europe,
but also of his own party. He lolls enthroned
on the front Opposition Bench, shoulder to
shoulder with trusty lieutenants who never
obey him, and backed up by political friends
who put no trust in him. On the day that
he took the party by the nose, the party
dropped off, and all that remains to C.-B. is
the nose. To this relic of ambition realised
he clings with true Scottish pertinacity. He
has wrapped it up in a napkin and hidden it;
probably it will never again be found, inasmuch
as C.-B. is invariably too bewildered to
know what he is doing. Harcourt bewilders
him, Asquith bewilders him, Morley bewilders
him, and latterly there has come that crowning
bewilderment of them all, Lord Rosebery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
C.-B. will go bewildered through whatever
remains to him of his term of office, and when
Liberalism takes thought to get properly rid
of him, he will be more bewildered still.
He is too Scotch to perceive that nobody
wants him, and if he saw it he is too Scotch
to go.</p>

<p>As for Lord Rosebery, the less said about
him the better. He is of Scotch stock, and
he had the good fortune to be born of an
English mother. But the Scotch blood in
him, the Scotch ineptitudes, the Scotch lack
of force prevail. He does everything by
turns and nothing long. Like Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman, he failed as a leader.
The statesman in him does not possess him;
it was a mere detail and a small one. As an
active politician he had to look around for a
model upon whom to shape himself. No
Scotchman can make the smallest sort of
mark, whether it be in politics or anything
else, without such a model. And in his
middle and later periods, at any rate, Lord
Rosebery has modelled himself upon Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Augustine Birrell, and as is usual with Scotchmen,
he has practically ousted Mr. Birrell
from the position of wit-monger to the Liberal
party. In the House of Commons Mr. Birrell
made a reputation, not because he was a
statesman or an orator, but because he had a
habit of firing off a kind of loose wit which
passes in the House of Commons for epigram.
When he spoke, the House was sure to be in
a roar within the half-hour, and one or two
of the phrases he made became texts for
leader-writers and made good “quote” in
Liberal speeches. With true Scottish enterprise,
Lord Rosebery determined to be a
second and a greater Birrell. He has succeeded.
In the House of Lords he enjoys a
reputation for saying things. He is also
credited, as was Mr. Birrell, with a nice taste
in letters. And, like Mr. Birrell, he is not
infrequently asked down to Little Puddlington
in order to help in the celebration of the
centenaries of Little Puddlington’s locally
born geniuses. He dare no more make a
serious speech, either in the House of Lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
or at Little Puddlington, than he dare call
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman out of his
name. Fireworks are expected from him,
and if they were not forthcoming, there
would be no Lord Rosebery. He passes for
a great empire builder, and along with the
worthy Dr. Jameson he figures among the
executors of the late Mr. Rhodes’s will. He
is the founder and President of the New Liberal
League, which will have nothing to do
with Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, but
his personal friendship with Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman
continues, and Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman is certainly not mentioned
in Mr. Cecil Rhodes’s will. In effect,
Lord Rosebery amounts to little more than
nothing. The Liberal League, which was to
make a great to-do in most matters appertaining
to Liberalism and government, fizzled
like a bad squib for three or four weeks, and
then Lord Rosebery went to Nice. That is
exactly the man. When his time comes,
when the country wants him, when Liberalism
wants him,—when, in fact, anybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
wants him,—he says, “Yes, yes, I am here,”
and immediately starts either for Nice or
Epsom. Scotch modesty overcomes him.
Scotch caution says, “You know you are a
fool; be careful to avoid ultimate risks.”
Scotch cowardice says, “If you go into battle
you may get hurt. Nice is much nicer.”
In newspaper columns Lord Rosebery’s
speeches read <em>admirably</em>, providing you do
not study them too closely, but any person
who has been present in the House of Lords
what time his Lordship was on his legs must
have gone away with shattered illusions.
Even as C.-B. stutters and blunders and
grabs for his words in the circumambient air,
so Lord Rosebery cackles and sentimentalises.
In appearance he is of about the build
and body of a draper. His voice is that of an
anæmic curate. There are always tears in
it at the wrong places, and on the whole it
makes you laugh. And having spoken, he
trots out like a Scotch sparrow, and with hat
a-tilt and arms under his coat-tails poises
himself perkily on the steps of the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to St. Stephen’s Hall, and waits for his carriage
to take him off to the station, and so to
Epsom or Nice. On the turf his reputation
is exactly the same in kind as his reputation
in politics. He is as variable as the shade
and as changeable as the moons. Sometimes
he does brilliant things, but he cannot
keep them up. In brief he is half Scotch
and half soda.</p>

<p>It is to these redoubtable Scotch persons
that England is looking for good government,
and hence it comes to pass that of late she
has had to govern herself. Out of Scotchmen
you can get little that is business-like
and little that is dignified, at any rate where
statesmanship is concerned. Their ambitions
are illimitable, but their powers of execution
not worth counting. They will fight
from behind cover to more or less bitter and
ignominious ends, but, like the Boer farmers,
to whom in many large respects they bear
the most striking resemblances, they never
know when they are beaten, and their warfare
deteriorates into mere brigandism and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
filibustering. When Britain was ruled by
Englishmen she wore the epithet Great
by good right; since she has been ruled
by Scotchmen she has well nigh lost it.</p>

<h2 id="IV">IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SCOT IN JOURNALISM</span></h2>

<p>We have seen on the word of Dr. Robertson
Nicoll that once upon a time it was the
ambition of every Scotch youth to become a
professor. Once upon a time, too, and one
does not need to quote authority for it, every
second child in kilts was devoted by his parents
to the ministry, and did, no doubt,
sooner or later attain to that admirable
office. But latterly the supply of Scotch
professors has been a good deal bigger than
the demand, and it has dawned upon the
slow Scottish intellect that £70 a year and a
manse is after all not exactly one of the
prizes of life. Therefore your stern, calculating
Scotch peasant has during late years
dedicated his son to the practice and service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of journalism. Now journalism, though the
Fourth estate, is the last of the professions.
The journalist who is making £500 a year,—at
any rate, the Scotch journalist who is
making £500 a year,—is the exception and
not the rule. Still, £500 a year, or, for that
matter, £250 a year, is wealth to your average
Scot, who, nine times out of ten, comes
hitherward from a district where persons
who once had a sovereign in their possession
are looked upon with awe and reverence.
Furthermore, journalism suits the Scot because
it is a profession into which you can
crawl without inquiry as to your qualifications,
and because it is a profession in which
the most middling talents will take you a
long way. The reporting staffs and sub-editorial
staffs of both the London and
provincial journals can, I think, boast a decidedly
decent leaven of Scotchmen. In Fleet
Street, if you do not happen to possess a
little of the Doric, you are at some disadvantage
in comprehending the persons with
whom you are compelled to talk. “Hoo arre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
ye the noo?” is the conventional greeting in
most newspaper offices. Also a large proportion
of the persons who come up the stairs
on personal business which usually turns out
to be the personal business of the persons,
and resolves itself into a request for reviewing,
or an offer to do another man’s work at
a cheap rate, are very Scotch indeed; and
while they drop the Doric word with fair success,
they cannot for the life of them get out
of the Doric idiom and the Doric accent.
Armed with a letter of introduction from
Professor McMoss—whom you do not know—and
with a sheaf of dog’s eared certificates
picked up at Scotch universities, they descend
upon you with the air of men who know
for a surety that you are dying for their services,
and when they go out, after wasting an
altogether unnecessary amount of your time
and temper, it is with black looks and a burning
conviction that you refused to employ
them because you know them to be so clever
that they might supplant you in your own
chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten years ago it was the man from Oxford
or Cambridge that was considered the essential
thing in journalism. Nowadays the attitude
of newspaper proprietors in want of a
smart man amounts to “No university man
need apply.” I do not think that we are
very far from the day when the tune will be
changed to “No Scotchman need apply.”
Numerically the Scotch journalist is unquestionably
strong. He possesses, too, certain
solid qualities which are undoubtedly desirable
in a journalist. For example, he is
punctual, cautious, dogged, unoriginal, and a
born galley-slave. You can knock an awful
lot of work out of him, and no matter how
little you pay him he may be depended upon
to sustain the dignity of the office in the
matter of clothes, external habits of life, and
a dog-like devotion to the hand that feeds
him and the foot that kicks him. In short,
he is a capital routine man, and if you have a
journal which you wish to maintain on the
ancient lines of stodge and flat-footedness,
the Scotchman does you admirably. But it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
is impossible to get away from the fact that
the vogue of the stolid, arid, stereotyped,
sleepy sort of journalism which satisfied the
last generation is rapidly going to pieces.
The contemporary world wants and will have
what it chooses to call the “live” journalist,
and the Scotchman who is a live journalist to
the extent of evolving anything bright or
subtle or suggestive or original has yet to be
found. At the present moment he is managing
to keep himself alive by imitation. As
a plagiarist of ideas, necessity has made him
a master. He knows that the reign of dulness
is coming to an end, and that the auld
wife journalism in whose benevolent presence
he has prosed and prosed for so many
years, is even now in her dotage and cannot
last much longer. So that he has taken
thought and determined to aim higher.
What man has done, a Scot can do. It is
not given to him to be witty and brilliant and
unhackneyed on a little oatmeal, but, thank
Heaven! he can always play sedulous ape,
and sedulous ape it shall be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>These remarks, of course, apply only to the
lower reaches of journalism, to the sub-editorial,
reportorial, contributorial, and contents
bill making departments. When it
comes to a question of editors, matters
assume quite a different complexion. A
Scotch editor is, as a rule, a sight for gods and
little fishes. Dr. Nicoll will tell you that the
Scot makes a good servant but a bad master.
This is the truth. Mercifully, you can count
the Scotch editors of London on the fingers
of one hand. So far as I am aware, there are
only two of them—Dr. Robertson Nicoll and
Dr. Nicol Dunn. Of one of them—him of the
<cite>Morning Post</cite>—you hear little, save that he
is a good fellow of no great parts, and that
he holds at his office a daily reception for
raw, unlicked Scotch youths who are come
newly over the border and crave the benefits
of his advice and assistance. Politically, his
paper can scarcely be considered a power;
its views on most questions are of no great
consequence, but it appears to have an enormous
circulation among the blue-blooded and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the wealthy, whose doings it chronicles with
touching fidelity and regularity, and without
the smallest reference to the notoriously independent
guinea stamp of Dr. Nicol Dunn’s
favourite poet. The other Dr. Nicoll is a
horse of another colour. He is all for Nonconformity
and the appraisement of healthy
and improving literature. Each of his papers
is a paper for the bosom of the family and
the ministers’ Monday, and warranted to do
all that can be done for the unco’ guid of
North Britain, for all Scottish writers of
whatever degree of merit or demerit, for Dr.
Nicoll’s English admirers, and Dr. Nicoll
himself. On every issue of these remarkable
publications Dr. Nicoll stamps the impress of
his own engaging personality. I have heard
it said by an admirer of his that he is three
men—a Scotch divine, a judge of letters, and
a journalist who never forgets that his main
business in life is to sell papers. These three
Dr. Nicolls are, I am assured, quite different
persons, inasmuch as the Doctor possesses
the blessed gift of detachment and thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
nothing of dictating an article on the genius
of Dr. Parker, a kindly appreciation of the
latest gory detective story, and a set of Sunday
afternoon verses or so in a single morning.
Of his lucubrations as a divine I shall
say nothing, because I have not studied them.
As a judge of letters, however, I take him to
be the most catholic scribbler in Europe.
Any author who is doing well—that is to say,
any author whose record of sales entitles him
to be considered a success—may always
reckon on a large hospitality in Dr. Nicoll’s
journals, and will always find Dr. Nicoll and
his merry men beaming round the corner, hat
in hand. It is a case of what would you like,
sir? all the time. Are you spending your
holiday cruising on the blue Mediterranean in
the Duchess of Puttleham’s yacht? Very
good. Paragraph in the column signed
“Man of Kent,” with a delicate reference to
your last great novel. Have you projects?
Equally good. “Mr. So-and-So is, I understand,
hard at work on his next great novel.”
Will your new book, 30,000 copies of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
have been sold before the day of publication,
make its appearance on April 1? Capital.
Send us portraits of yourself at all ages from
three months to the present day, pictures of
the modest tenement in which you were born,
and of your present town house and little
place in the country, and, bless your heart,
we will do the rest. Do people say that the
great novel, of which you have sold fifty
million copies in England and America, is a
pot-boiler and a stunner? Dear, dear me!
You have our heartiest sympathies, sir, and
if you would like to vindicate your character
as an artist in a couple of pages of the <cite>British
Weekly</cite>, why, my dear sir, we are at your
service. I do not say that there is any terrific
harm in this species of enterprise; that it
pleases the mass of mankind and therefore
sells papers goes without saying. On the
other hand, it is quite subversive of the best
interests of letters, and therefore I am inclined
to think—and I set it down with great
sorrow—that Dr. Nicoll, in spite of his devotional
connection is, if he have any force in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
letters at all, a distinctly dubious and undesirable
force.</p>

<p>As an example of what the <cite>Bookman</cite> really
can do when it has a mind, let us quote the
following review of a book by Mr. Le Gallienne:</p>

<p>“Mr. Le Gallienne is the Dick Whittington
of song. His story reminds us of that other
Richard, who, one summer morning many
hundreds of years ago, sat listening to the
bells of distant London. The one carried his
little all tied up in a handkerchief slung to
the end of a stick; the other came to London
to seek his fortune with a sheaf of manuscript
poems in his pocket and any number of
poems singing in his head. Now, Mr. Le
Gallienne is a figure in ‘society,’ and lives in
a beautiful house crowded with costly <i lang="fr">bric-à-brac</i>
and valuable books; but I like to think
sometimes of the sloping-roofed room, nestling
under the gables of one of the most picturesque
buildings left in London—quaint
old Staple’s Inn—which was his first home in
the great city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“It was in just such a room that one might
picture Chatterton—rough-hewn oak beams
above, uneven oak flooring below, and in
front a ‘magic casement’ ‘opening upon the
foam’—not of ‘perilous seas’—but of perilous
streets, where the black tides of hurrying
human creatures never ceases [<i lang="la">sic</i>] to ebb
and flow. Here were his bed, his books, and
his papers. Here, too, though shillings were
probably scarcer than sovereigns are now,
were the flowers, which the extravagant
tenant of the prophet’s chamber was never
too poor to deny himself—the flowers which
were the inspiration of many of his songs.
And here, on a little stove in a corner, he
would himself boil the water with which to
brew for his visitor the tea or coffee that he
would hand round with the ease and grace of
a duke dispensing hospitality in his castle.</p>

<p>“I have been betrayed into this personal
reminiscence by reading how ‘Love, a poor
poet in need of a room for his bed and his
rhymes,’ and ‘Beauty, a little blue-eyed girl
who loved him,’ transformed into a seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
heaven a single seventh-story room which
they had rented, for surely ‘Love’ stands for
Mr. Le Gallienne himself, and ‘Beauty’ for
the sweet-faced young wife with dove-like
eyes and dove-like voice, whose loss has been
the great sorrow of the poet’s life. It was in
a beautiful idyll called <cite>A Seventh-Story
Heaven</cite> that I read of the transformation,
and this brings me to the fact with which I
started or ought to have started—that Mr.
Le Gallienne has published a new book. In
other words, he has set open the door of
another House of Welcome on the literary
highway. And surely ’twere as hard, on a
glaring summer’s noon, for a tired and thirsty
traveller to pass by some ancient hostelry,
through the ivy-hung porch of which he sees,
lying back in cool shadow, a quaint stone-paven
nook with a glimpse of green lawn and
box-bordered flower beds beyond, as it were
for the literary wayfarer to turn aside from a
volume titled like Mr. Le Gallienne’s, <cite>The
Prose Fancies of a Poet</cite>! Could a more
alluring sign be set aswing before the doors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
any literary House of Refreshment? Nor
when we have entered are we disappointed by
the bill of fare which is put before us. ‘A
Seventh-Story Heaven,’ ‘Spring by Parcel
Post,’ ‘A Poet in the City,’ ‘Brown Roses,’
‘Death and Two Friends,’ ‘A Seaport in the
Moon’—here surely is a list which might stir
the imagination even of unimaginative folk.</p>

<p>“The score or so of ‘Fancies’ which form
the volume are, as was only to be expected,
of very varying merit. To the opening idyll,
‘A Seventh-Story Heaven,’ reference has
already been made. Mr. Le Gallienne’s
friend and neighbour, Mr. Grant Allen, a delightful
naturalist and essayist, whom society
by her neglect has turned into a thrower into
her midst of Nihilistic bombs in the guise of
novels, could bear witness to the fact that
nests are built in stranger places, but surely
never did love-birds find such strange quarters
for their home as this eyrie at the top of
a building, the ground floor of which was a
sailor’s tavern. But dingy and unlovely as
the spot may be, it is made beautiful for us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in Mr. Le Gallienne’s page as the scene of a
love-story so exquisitely told, and so tremulous
with tender pathos, that we can only
compare it to the work of the gentle Elia.</p>

<p>“I cannot say as much for the second
Fancy, whimsically entitled ‘Spring by Parcel
Post,’ for it is surely an error of taste
which every admirer of Mr. Le Gallienne’s
genius must regret. ‘The big Dutch hyacinths,’
he writes, ‘are already shamelessly
<i lang="fr">enceinte</i> with their buxom waxen blooms, so
fat and fragrant—(one is already delivered of
a fine blossom. Well, that is a fine baby, to
be sure! says [<i lang="la">sic</i>] the other hyacinths with
babes no less bonny under their own green
apron—all waiting for the doctor Sun).’</p>

<p>“I wonder if this offends the taste of my
readers as much as it offends mine. Mr. Le
Gallienne may quote science and physiology
against me, but I must confess that in regard
to children and flowers I like to keep my very
thoughts free from the smirch of sex, though
I concede and contend that the smirch is entirely
of man’s, not of God’s making. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the passage I have quoted there is a certain
coarseness of associations which is painful in
connection with the purest and most perfect
thing on God’s earth—a flower. It was to
me as if hot hands were tampering with the
petals of a lily. The air seemed to become
close as I read, and it was not until I had had
a dip—as into cool spring water—into the
flower-poems of Burns and Wordsworth that
I could go on with my reading of <cite>Prose
Fancies</cite>.</p>

<p>“Let us turn the page and forget that one
of the most delicately-minded of living poets,
whose work has hitherto been distinguished
for exquisite fancy and excellent taste, should
so far have ‘lost himself’ as to have written it.</p>

<p>“<cite>Variations upon Whitebait</cite> is a caprice
as skilful as Rossetti’s famous sonnet, <cite>A
Match with the Moon</cite>. It is a very curiosity
in similes, and though Mr. Le Gallienne will
toss you a fresh and apt simile for every fish
upon your fork, though he introduce as many
variations as a pianist introduces into <cite>Home,
Sweet Home</cite>, yet the essay is not all variation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
but has a pretty story running like the thread
of a tune throughout.</p>

<p>“As for the ‘Letter to an Unsuccessful
Literary Man,’ I would suggest that it be
lithographed in order that the successful
author may use it as a form with which to
reply to the uninvited correspondent. If
only Mr. Le Gallienne could induce amateurs
to read this letter instead of writing letters of
their own to that most baited of beings, the
professional author, what a boon he would
confer upon his fellow craftsmen! The essay,
<cite>On Loving One’s Enemies</cite>, is scarcely written
in the spirit which its title and its protestations
of charity might lead us to suppose. It
strikes me as somewhat self-conscious and
defiant; but <cite>Death and Two Friends</cite> contains
some really signal work. For the gem of the
book, however, we must turn to <cite>A Seaport in
the Moon</cite>. This and the opening chapter,
<cite>A Seventh-Story Heaven</cite>, are in themselves
worth the modest sum which the publishers
ask for the volume. <cite>A Seaport in the Moon</cite>
is an exquisitely beautiful fancy. Mr. Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Gallienne was in the right mood when he
wrote it, and when he is in the mood he is a
magician. His page glows like a painter’s
palette with rich colours, and the pictures
come and go before us like sunset pageant.”</p>

<p>Apart from the delicious Scotch snobbery
which jumps at you from every line of
this admirable piece of criticism, and leaving
altogether out of the question the downright
vulgarity and ineptitude of it, one would like
to know what the <cite>Bookman</cite> would say if Mr.
Le Gallienne published a similar book to-morrow.
At the time when this review was
published, Mr. Le Gallienne was in the zenith
of his somewhat slender and rarefied popularity.
He had captured the heart of Kensington
with dainty vacuity. His locks were
curled and perfumed; he figured prettily and
replied to the toast of letters at the dinners
of literary clubs, and was the delicate high
priest of a little school of hot pressed poetry
and vapid prose. The <cite>Bookman</cite>, of course,
was bound to salute him with a chaste appreciation.
Since then the world has gone on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and left Mr. Le Gallienne somewhat behind
it, also Mr. Le Gallienne himself has settled in
America and cut off his hair. No more does
he publish the booklet that takes the town;
no longer does he write of the “Woman’s
Third” or sigh over the deception of tender-hearted
schoolgirls, who have provided
one with a sonnet. In short, his laurel hangs
dustily on a nail at the “Bodley Head,”
and the raven locks that once bore it have
probably by this time gone to help in the
making of a mess of honest builders’ mortar.
So that the <cite>Bookman</cite> knows him no more.</p>

<p>From the issue of the <cite>Bookman</cite> which contains
the review above quoted I take a couple
of “news notes.”</p>

<p>“Mr. J. M. Barrie has finished a book on
his mother, which will be entitled <cite>Margaret
Ogilvy</cite>. It is perhaps the most beautiful and
exquisite piece of work he has yet accomplished.
It is not a biography in the ordinary
sense, but gives aspects and incidents of
his mother’s life in the style which Mr. Barrie’s
readers know, keeping close throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
to facts. The volume will be published in
this country by Messrs. Hodder and Stoughton,
and in America by Messrs. Scribner.”</p>

<p>“Mr. S. R. Crockett’s new novel is to be
entitled <cite>Lochinvar</cite>. Some eminent critics
who have had the privilege of reading the
portion already written are enthusiastic in
their praise of the work. It is said to be
more in the manner of <cite>The Lilac Sun-Bonnet</cite>
than some of Mr. Crockett’s more recently
published novels.”</p>

<p>So much for the Scotch journalist.</p>

<h2 id="V">V<br />
<span class="smaller">THRUMS AND DRUMTOCHTY</span></h2>

<p>The Scot abroad, or at any rate the Scot
that one knows and loves in London, is a
creature so winning and delectable in character
that one proceeds to the study of the
Scot at home with anticipations of the most
pleasurable kind. The best way to study the
Scot at home is, of course, to consult the
works of those eminent Scottish writers, Dr.
J. M. Barrie and Dr. Ian Maclaren, with occasional
reference to Dr. S. R. Crockett. Dr.
Barrie and Dr. Maclaren (otherwise Watson)
have been at pains to portray for us, with
what Dr. Nicoll would no doubt call loving
and exquisite fidelity, the peoples and manners
and customs of two Scotch parishes,
named respectively Thrums and Drumtochty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Both, one gathers, are the prettiest, most
charitable, and most God-fearing communities
to be found upon this globe of sinful continents.
Butter will not melt, and ginger is
not hot in the mouth either at Thrums or
Drumtochty. The various books of the
chronicles of that earthly paradise, Thrums,
are of formidable number, and I do not profess
to have read more than five of them.
But I have read enough to know all that I
want to know about Thrums. Here, it
seems, “twenty years ago, hundreds of
weavers lived and died Thoreaus ’ben the
hoose without knowing it.” Here also lived
“the dear old soul who originally induced me
to enter the Auld Licht Kirk” and was “as
sweet and pure a woman as I ever knew”;
also Tammy Mealmaker, who died a bachelor
and “had been soured in his youth by disappointment
in love of which he spoke but
seldom,” also Tibbie McQuhattay, “at whom
you may smile, but, ah! I know what she
was at the sick-bedside”; also Whinny Webster,
who ate peppermints in church, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
when detected in the act “gave one wild
scream”; and “straightway became a God-fearing
man”; also Hendry Munn, “who
was the only man in Thrums who did not
quake when the minister looked at him”;
also Jess McQumpha, who “sat at the window
for twenty years or more, looking at the
world as through a telescope,” and who “was
possessed of a sweet, untarnished soul”;
also Leeby, who “died in the back end of the
year I have been speaking of”; and Jamie,
who did the home-coming, and gaed somebody
“sic a look”; and last, but not least,
in childishness, the Little Minister and Babbie.
For blithering sentiment of the cheapest
and most obvious sort, these personages
have certainly never been equalled. The
whole tone of the Thrums chronicles is as
bathotic as it could be made even by a
Scotchman, and wherever one turns one
finds Mr. Barrie trotting out creatures of a
sentiment so slobbery that it would be
eschewed even by the scribbling, simpering
misses at a seminary. And at Drumtochty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
need one say, Dr. Ian Maclaren introduces
you to the same set of silly figures. Dr.
Maclaren, it is true, put in the front of his
show a cunning Scotch farmer whose attempts
to cheat his landlord, the worthy
doctor,—parson as he is,—would evidently
have you smile, but all the rest of his people
are rare and radiant pieces of virtue, clothed
round in Scotch flesh and sandy hair, and
speaking the most uncompromising dialect.
For example, there is Mrs. Elspeth Macfadyen.
This lady’s claim to greatness is not
exactly of a moral kind, being based on the
circumstance that she obtained a penny
above the market price for her butter. All
the farmers’ wives of the Scotch romances
invariably do this. Even Dr. Crockett’s lady
of the lilac sunbonnet made the best butter
in three parishes. The butter woman, however,
is not intended to count, so that we will
let her go by, and proceed duly to note the
heavenly dispositions of the rest of the Drumtochtyans.
In the first place, there is Baxter
of Burnbrae. Burnbrae, it seems, “had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to make the choice that has been offered to
every man since the world began”; in other
words, he had to choose between losing his
farm and changing his kirk.</p>

<p>“‘Well, Baxter,’ said the factor in his
room next day, ‘your offer is all right in the
money, and we’ll soon settle the building.
By the way, I suppose you’ve thought over
that kirk affair, and will give your word to
attend the Established Church, eh?’</p>

<p>“‘Ye may be sure that A’ve gien a’ ye
said ma best judgment, and there’s naething
I wudna dae to be left in Burnbrae, but this
thing ye ask A canna grant.’</p>

<p>“‘Why not?’ and the factor, lounging in
his chair, eyed Burnbrae contemptuously as
he stood erect before him. ‘My groom tells
me that there is not a grain of difference between
all those kirks in Scotland, and that
the whole affair is just downright bad temper,
and I believe he’s right.’</p>

<p>“‘A wudna say onything disrespectfu’, sir,
but it’s juist possible that naither you nor
your groom ken the history o’ the Free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Church; but ye may be sure sensible men
and puir fouk dinna mak’ sic sacrifices for
bad temper.’”</p>

<p>Which is exceeding good of Burnbrae, if
a little too bad of Dr. Maclaren.</p>

<p>And our excellent Scotch author makes
Burnbrae conclude the interview thus: “‘Sir,’
he said, with great solemnity, ‘I pray God
you may never have such sorrow as you have
sent on my house this day.’” I should very
much doubt whether there is a Scotchman in
all Scotland who would not have made quite
a different ending with much fist-shaking and
calling down of curses in it.</p>

<p>Well, in the result, Burnbrae does leave
his farm; anyway, there is a sale, or as the
Scotch elegantly term it, a roup. And what
happens? Why, the neighbours—good, honest
bodies—turn up in their thousands and
buy in Burnbrae’s farming stock at noble
prices, bidding high for everything in order
that Burnbrae may at least have a good roup.
Meanwhile the minister of the kirk with
which Burnbrae scorned to become a member<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
has communicated with the owner of the
soil, the Earl of Kilspindie to wit, and to
Burnbrae Kilspindie writes, “Meet me in
Muirtown on Friday.” On Friday, Burnbrae
meets the Earl. They crack together
of Burnbrae’s son, the sergeant, who, like all
the other Scotch sergeants of fiction, has just
won the Victoria Cross. “‘There will be no
speaking to Mrs. Baxter now after this exploit
of the sergeant’s! When I read it on
my way home I was as proud as if he had
been my own son. It was a gallant deed, and
well deserves the Cross. He’ll be getting his
commission some day. Lieutenant Baxter!
That will stir the Glen, eh?’” Then they
touch on the matter of the farm, and the tears
come to Burnbrae’s eyes. “‘Athocht,’ he said,
‘when yir message cam, that maybe ye hed
anither mind than yir factor, and wud send
me back tae Jean wi’ guid news in ma mooth.’</p>

<p>“‘Gin it be yir wull that we flit, A’ll mak
nae mair complaint, an’ there’s nae bitterness
in ma hert. But A wud like ye tae ken
that it ’ill be a sair pairtin’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘For twa hundred years an’ mair there’s
been a Baxter at Burnbrae and a Hay at
Kilspindie; ane wes juist a workin’ farmer,
an’ the other a belted earl, but gude freends
an’ faithfu’; an’, ma Lord, Burnbrae wes as
dear tae oor fouk as the castle wes tae
yours.</p>

<p>“‘A mind that day the Viscount cam’ o’
age, an’ we gaithered tae wush him weel, that
A saw the pictures o’ the auld Hays on yir
walls, an’ thocht hoo mony were the ties that
bund ye tae yir hame.</p>

<p>“We haena pictures nor gowden treasures,
but there’s an auld chair at oor fireside, an’
A saw ma grandfather in it when A wes a
laddie at the schule, an’ A mind him tellin’
me that his grandfather hed sat in lang
afore. It’s no worth muckle, an’ it’s been
often mended, but A’ll no like tae see it carried
oot frae Burnbrae.</p>

<p>“‘There is a Bible, tae, that hes come
doon, father tae son, frae 1690, and ilka
Baxter hes written his name in it, an’
“farmer at Burnbrae,” but it’ll no’ be dune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
again, for oor race ’ill be awa frae Burnbrae
for ever.</p>

<p>“‘Be patient wi’ me, ma Lord, for it’s the
laist time we’re like tae meet, an’ there’s
anither thing A want tae say, for it’s heavy
on ma hert.</p>

<p>“‘When the factor told me within this
verra room that we maun leave, he spoke o’
me as if A hed been a lawless man, an’ it cut
me mair than ony ither word.</p>

<p>“‘Ma Lord, it’s no’ the men that fear
their God that ’ill brak the laws, an’ A ken
nae Baxter that wes ither than a loyal man
tae his King and country.</p>

<p>“‘Ma uncle chairged wi’ the Scots Greys
at Waterloo, and A mind him tellin’, when
A wes a wee laddie, hoo the Hielanders cried
oot, “Scotland for ever,” as they passed.</p>

<p>“‘A needna tell ye aboot ma brither, for
he wes killed by yir side afore Sebastopol,
and the letter ye sent tae Burnbrae is keepit
in that Bible for a heritage.</p>

<p>“‘A’ll mention naething aither o’ ma ain
laddie, for ye’ve said mair than wud be richt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
for me, but we coont it hard that when oor
laddie hes shed his blude like an honest man
for his Queen, his auld father and mither sud
be driven frae the hame their forebears hed
for seeven generations.’”</p>

<p>What a family! The sergeant with the
V. C., ma uncle who chairged wi’ the Scots
Greys, and ma brither who wes killed by yir
side afore Sebastopol, and, of course, the
Bible has to be lugged in. What wonder
that at this outburst of Scottish reticence, so
to say, Lord Kilspindie rose to his feet. In
the twinkling of a paragraph or two the shallow,
monstrous, black-hearted English factor
is, need one say, coming in for a bit of his
Lordship’s mind.</p>

<p>“‘You’ll reduce the rent to the old figure,
and put in the name of John Baxter, and let
it be for the longest period we ever give on
the estate.’</p>

<p>“‘But, Lord Kilspindie … I …
did you know⸺’</p>

<p>“‘Do as I command you without another
word,’ and his Lordship was fearful to behold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Baxter goes home to his farm victor.
The news goes down the Glen,—or up it as
the case may be,—and the question arises as
to what Baxter is going to do with the
farm that has been denuded of live stock and
implements, and before you can say Jack
Robinson every man who has made a purchase
at the Burnbrae roup is off to Burnbrae
with his purchase and dumps it down and
leaves it there, free, gratis, and for nothing.</p>

<p>Now the whole of this story is simply ridiculous.
Even if one swallowed the English
factor who had turned an old tenant out of
his farm on a question of kirk; even if one
swallowed the neighbourly bidding up at the
roup (not to mention the Victoria Cross and
the fighting uncle and brither), Dr. Maclaren
cannot make us believe that a Scotchman
would part freely and without price with
anything that he had once bought. And
what a reflection it is upon the dulness of the
patient, resigned, and tear-stricken Burnbrae,
that he did not have the presence of
mind to address dear, good Earl of Kilspindie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
before the roup came off! But had he done
that, of course, Dr. Ian Maclaren could not
have made his point as to the incredible generosity
of the dwellers about Drumtochty.</p>

<p>But the Glen could boast much more remarkable
men than Burnbrae. There is
Drumsheugh, about as pale a martyr as a
martyr-loving people could wish for. Drumsheugh
passed in the Glen for a hard man and
a miser, “a wratch that ’ill hae the laist
penny in a bargain, and no spend a saxpence
gin he can keep it.” But Drumsheugh was
sairly misjudged. He carried his tribble for
mair than thirty year, and then unburdened
himself of it over the whiskey to his friend,
Dr. Maclure. “‘It wes for anither A githered,
an’ as fast as A got the gear A gied it
awa’,’ and Drumsheugh sprang to his feet,
his eyes shining; ‘it wes for love’s sake A
haggled an’ schemed, an’ stairved an’ toiled,
till A’ve been a byword at kirk an’ market
for nearness; A did it a’, an’ bore it a’, for
ma love, an’ for … ma love A wud
hae dune ten times mair.’” Naturally, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the lady in the case was named Marget, the
bonniest as weel as the noblest o’ weemen
(they all are). Well, Drumsheugh fell in
love with Marget when she was in her bloom.
With the true Scottish reticence, however,
he omitted to mention his condition to the
object of his affection, so that she went off
quite properly and married a feckless person
named Whinnie, who, being feckless, got himself
into persistent holes for money, so that
Whinnie and Marget were continually being
threatened with the loss of their happy home,
and all the time Drumsheugh, for love’s sake,
kept on sending money through his solicitors
in the name of Whinnie’s rich uncle in America.
For thirty years Whinnie continued to
be a drain on his purse, and Drumsheugh
spake no word, but went on loving Marget
all the time. Being made the recipient of
this astonishing confidence, Maclure is for
posting off to Marget right away, and she,
good woman, posts as swiftly off to Drumsheugh.
It is a case of ae fond kiss and
dinna peety me, Marget; A’ve hed ma reward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
an’ A’m mair than content; and we
wind up with the biblical reflection that
“They which shall be accounted worthy …
neither marry nor are given in marriage …
but are as the angels of God in Heaven”;
which is all very pretty and all very Scotch,
and all made to sell. We may note, however,
that Drumsheugh did not stand alone
in Drumtochty for his devotion to a lost love.
The fetch is too easy and too safe for Dr.
Maclaren to allow himself the use of it only
once. There was a man in Drumtochty who
had been counted a cynic and a railer against
“merridge,” even as Drumsheugh was accounted
a miser. In the course of nature this
man, Jamie Soutar, came to die. On his death
bed he remarked to a friend, “‘Wha sed A
wes against merridge, Doctor Davidson?’
and Jamie’s face flushed. ‘Did ever man or
woman hear me speak lichtly o’ the mystery
o’ love? The Glen hes thocht me an auld
cankered bachelor, an’ A’ve seen a lass leave
her lad’s side on the sicht o’ me. Little they
kent!’” And it transpires that “‘forty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>

<p>“‘A set aff tae her hoose, and ilka turn o’

<p>“‘It wes her throat, an’ the doctor wes

<p>After that, any child could tell you what
Jamie’s “last words” would be.</p>

<p>“‘Menie,’ he cried, suddenly, with a new

<h2 id="VI">VI<br />
<span class="smaller">BARBIE</span></h2>

<p>From Thrums and Drumtochty the blest
to Barbie, which is also in Scotland, may be
fairly described as a far cry. In the beautiful
communities conceived by Drs. Barrie
and Maclaren the milk of human nature flows
like a river; everybody lives, not for his or
her foolish self, but for somebody else; everybody
dies for somebody else; all bachelors
are faithful to the sweethearts of their youth
“for forty year and more”; all the women
make the best butter in Galloway; all the
girls are pretty and angelic of temperament,
and, in short, Thrums and Drumtochty are
little bits of heaven dropped on to the map
of Scotland. But Barbie is not of heavenly
origin in the least. The chronicles of Barbie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
have been put into print for us by Mr.
George Douglas, and he calls his book <cite>The
House with the Green Shutters</cite>. If he had
wanted a just title for it, he might very well
have called it “The Unspeakable Scot.”
Nowhere in letters does there exist such an
unsophisticated revelation of the minds and
habits of a savage and barbarous people as
is to be found in this book. It is fiction, of
course; but it is that kind of fiction which
has been written from observation, and is
practically a human document. The Barbie
crowd do not waste any time on little acts of
kindness; there is not a man among them
who cannot fairly be termed mean. If meanness
were the only fault one might be able to
put up with Barbie; but the inhabitants
have graver failings. They are all dour;
they are all bitter-hearted; they are all
greedy; they are all merciless and full of the
wickedest guile. Gourlay, who is the hero of
the piece, counts among the most unpleasant
persons one has ever met in a book. He has
“the black glower in his een,” and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Scotch qualities of envy, hatred, overweening
pride, and tyranny find full expression in
him. For years he has trampled the rest of
Barbie under his feet, and all Barbie hates
him. “He had been born and bred in Barbie,
and he knew his townsmen—oh, yes—he
knew them. He knew they laughed because
he had no gift of the gab, and could
never be provost, or bailie, or elder, or even
chairman of the gasworks! ‘Oh, verra
well, verra well, let Connal and Brodie and
Allardyce have the talk, and manage the
town’s affairs’ (he was damned if they should
manage his!); he, for his part, preferred the
substantial reality.” So that he treated
Barbie with contempt; he had a civil word
for nobody, and his manners were as bad as
only Scotch manners can be. It was these
very manners, however, that helped to bring
about his downfall. One fine morning a
stranger walked into Barbie; he was a
Scotchman, and in his appearance there
was “an air of dirty and pretentious well-to-doness,”
which is the Scotch way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Well, this stranger ran up against Mr.
Gourlay.</p>

<p>“‘It’s a fine morning, Mr. Gourlay!’ simpered
the stranger. His air was that of a
forward tenant who thinks it a great thing
to pass remarks on the weather with his laird.</p>

<p>“Gourlay cast a look at the dropping
heavens.</p>

<p>“‘Is that <em>your</em> opinion?’ said he. ‘I fail
to see ’t mysel’.…’</p>

<p>“The stranger laughed, a little deprecating
giggle. ‘I meant it was fine weather for
the fields,’ he explained.…</p>

<p>“‘Are <em>you</em> a farmer, then?’ Gourlay nipped
in, with his eye on the white waistcoat.</p>

<p>“‘Oh—oh, Mr. Gourlay! A farmer, no.
Hi—hi! I’m not a farmer. I daresay, now,
you have no mind of <em>me</em>!’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ said Gourlay, regarding him very
gravely and steadily with his dark eyes. ‘I
cannot say, sir, that I have the pleasure of
remembering <em>you</em>!’</p>

<p>“‘Man, I’m a son of auld John Wilson of
Brigabee!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘Oh, auld Wilson, the mole-catcher!’
said contemptuous Gourlay. ‘What’s this
they christened him now? “Toddling Johnnie,”
was it noat?’</p>

<p>“Wilson coloured. But he sniggered to
gloss over the awkwardness of the remark.
A coward always sniggers when insulted,
pretending that the insult is only a joke of
his opponent, and therefore to be laughed
aside. So he escapes the quarrel which he
fears a show of displeasure might provoke.</p>

<p>“But, though Wilson was not a handy
man, it was not timidity only that caused his
tame submission to Gourlay.…”</p>

<p>Here you have the two types of Scotchmen
presented in speaking likenesses, namely,
the bully, primed with “repressiveness” and
“force of character,” and the giggling lickspittle
who does not know how to fight and
consequently falls back on livid revenges.</p>

<p>Later, Wilson ventures on a remark about
business. Gourlay retorts:</p>

<p>“‘Business! Heavens, did ye hear him
talking? What did Toddling Johnny’s son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
know about business? What was the world
coming to? To hear him setting up his face
there and asking the best merchant in the
town whether business was brisk! It was
high time to put him in his place, the conceited
upstart, shoving himself forward like
an equal!’</p>

<p>“For it was the assumption of equality
implied by Wilson’s manner that offended
Gourlay—as if mole-catcher’s son and monopolist
were discussing, on equal terms, matters
of interest to them both.</p>

<p>“‘Business!’ he said, gravely. ‘Well, I’m
not well acquainted with your line, but I
believe mole-traps are cheap—if ye have
any idea of taking up the oald trade!’</p>

<p>“Wilson’s eyes flickered over him, hurt and
dubious. His mouth opened—then shut—then
he decided to speak after all. ‘Oh, I
was thinking Barbie would be very quiet,’
said he, ‘compared wi’ places where they
have the railway! I was thinking it would
need stirring up a bit.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, ye was thinking that, was ye?’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
birred Gourlay, with a stupid man’s repetition
of his jibe. ‘Well, I believe there’s a
grand opening in the moleskin line, so <em>there’s</em>
a chance for ye! My quarrymen wear out
their breeks in no time!’</p>

<p>“Wilson’s face, which had swelled with
red shame, went a dead white. ‘Good morning!’
he said, and started rapidly away
with a vicious dig of his stick upon the wet
road.</p>

<p>“Goo-ood mor-r-ning, serr!’ Gourlay
birred after him; ‘goo-ood mor-r-ning, serr!’
He felt he had been bright this morning. He
had put the branks on Wilson!”</p>

<p>In spite of his smallness and rattiness, Wilson
is not without his Scotch feelings, so
that he goes away and schemes. And the
end of his scheming is that he becomes a
trade rival of Gourlay’s in Barbie. Perhaps
man never had a more unscrupulous or fiendishly
cunning trade rival. The end of it is
that Gourlay is brought to the verge of bankruptcy
and dies miserably, while Barbie is
left to go on its wicked way rejoicing. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
fight between two ugly natures is watched
by the population of Barbie with great zest;
the combatants are continually egged on by
the sarcastic comments of the neebors, who
practically hate them both as they hate one
another. And the result is a picture which
rivals in hideousness anything of the kind
which has hitherto been attempted. From
<cite>The House with the Green Shutters</cite> one is able
to gather what life in a Scotch township
really means. One understands, too, how it
comes to pass that the Scotchmen one meets
in London are so wanting in the qualities
which render communication between men
possible and tolerable. Persons who have
spent their youth in such a township as Barbie
must of necessity have altogether wrong
views about life and the reason for it. Their
hand is against every man; to get and to
keep by fair means or foul is their sole ambition,
and of the finer feelings which keep
existence sweet they know absolutely nothing.
It is a squalid picture, and not in the
least flattering to Scotland. Yet the Scotch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
critics have not ventured to deny its authenticity;
indeed, they admit that there is a
great deal in it. Mr. Douglas, the author of
<cite>The House with the Green Shutters</cite>, is himself
a Scotchman, and to malign his country is
about the last thing you may expect from a
Scotch writer; his tendency usually is the
other way. To put Thrums, Drumtochty,
and Barbie into one vessel, as it were, to mix
them and make a blend of them is probably
to get at the truth about the Scot as he lives
and moves in his native element. And
when one has done this, one can only imagine
that the average Scotchman is a compound
of two things,—to wit, the knave and the
fool.</p>

<h2 id="VII">VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE BARD</span></h2>

<p>In England “the Bard” stands for Shakespeare;
in Scotland, of course, when you say
“the Bard” you mean Robert Burns. Nothing
that Scotland ever possessed has abided
so firmly in the heart of the Scotchman as
“the Bard”—Robert Burns, that is to say.
An Englishman can forget that Shakespeare
ever existed. A Scotsman never forgets that
Robert Burns was a Scotchman. Morn,
noon, and night he will talk to you of Burns
if you give him half a chance. Till Dr. J. M.
Barrie and Dr. Crockett came in, the Scotchman
had no other book but a dog’s-eared
Burns, from which work he gathered his
views of life, including justification for his
vices. Round the person and poetry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Burns numberless well-meaning people have
found it worth their while to write a literature.
There was a time when “the Bard”
received praise only from mere poets. Keats
wrote sonnets about him; Montgomery offered
him the usual graceful tribute; Wordsworth
mentioned him cheek by jowl with
Chatterton; and even Eliza Cook had her
metrical say about him. Then the prose men
came along—Carlyle, Stevenson, Henley.
Carlyle took the man Burns and set him up
for a tremendous genius, with “a head of
gold.” Stevenson, whom probably for this
reason the Scotch do not love, ventured to
suggest that Mr. Burns had “feet of clay.”
Mr. Henley followed and accentuated the
feet of clay, greatly to the annoyance of all
Scotland. It ill becomes the present writer
to attempt to do what has already been done
so well, therefore he will say nothing about
either heads of gold or feet of clay. But
Robert Burns is everybody’s property, and
one may crave leave even at this late day to
say about him the thing that one believes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
The whole truth about Burns may be summed
up in half a dozen words. He was a poet,
he was a loose liver, and he was a ploughman.
And if one looks through his writings, one is
forced to the conclusion that he owes his
fame to the circumstances that he was a
loose liver and a ploughman rather than to
the circumstance that he was a poet. To
take up the works of Burns in one volume
and to glance through them haphazard, assaying
here a page and there a page, is to
come to a knowledge of him which is rather
staggering. As I write, I have before me the
Globe Edition of the <cite>Complete Works of
Robert Burns</cite>, edited by Alexander Smith.
It is a portly book, and one is aware that it
contains matter which is really of excellent
quality, considered as poetry. Yet to test it
by chance openings is to perceive that in the
main Burns, as poet, has been vastly overrated.
On page 211, for example, which is about the
middle of the book, I find five pieces, not one
of which is good enough to grace a common
valentine. We lead off with <cite>Peggy’s Charms</cite>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<div class="verse">I love my Peggy’s angel air,</div>
<div class="verse">Her face so truly, heavenly fair,</div>
<div class="verse">Her native grace so void of art;</div>
<div class="verse">But I adore my Peggy’s heart.</div>
</div>

<p>Not to put too fine a point upon it, this
is arrant drivel, villainously rhymed. Then
comes <cite>Up in the Morning Early</cite>:</p>

<p>One surmises <cite>Up in the Morning Early</cite> belongs
to “that great body of treasurable
songs with which Burns has dowered his
countrymen.” On the face of it, to find
sorrier stuff one would have to visit an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
music hall. There is not a glimmer of
poetry in any one of the twelve lines, and the
composition as a whole might have been
written by a precocious infant in a Glasgow
Board School. After this precious production
we are regaled with the appended touching
piece of sentimentalism:</p>

<p>The spectacle of a gentleman having somebody’s
“dear idea” entwined, whether tenderly
or otherwise, round his heart would
surely set a cat laughing. And the loving of
Jean, though mountains frown and deserts
howl and oceans roar between, is clearly the
merest fustian. Follows <cite>I Dreamed I Lay
Where Flowers were Springing</cite>—a stupid sort
of dream to say the least of it. The flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
it seems, were springing “gaily in the sunny
beam,” and the poet, it seems, not only
“dreamed that he lay among them” but,
that he was “list’ning to the wild birds singing
by a falling crystal stream,” which is a very
common and hackneyed thing for a tenth-rate
poet to do. But mark:</p>

<p class="noindent">As a matter of fact, <cite>Scots Wha Hae</cite> is one
those poems which most people have heard
about and few people have read. For this
reason I print it <i lang="la">in extenso</i> and commend it
to the consideration of the critical. Is it
really noble, or marvellous, or inspiring?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Would it pass muster as a new performance?
Is it a whit the better, or sounder, or more
convincing than <cite>God Save the King</cite>, which
everybody cheerfully admits is not poetry?
I, for one, hae me doots.</p>

<p>Like Artemus Ward and writers of “Wot-the-Orfis-Boy
Finks” order, Burns owes
much of his seeming inspiration and humour
to an uncouth orthography. Put into decent
English, many of his most vaunted
lays amount to nothing at all. Indeed, practically
the whole of the <em>poetry</em> which came
from his pen could be compressed into a book
of fifty pages. I do not say that much of the
matter one would have to include in those
fifty pages is not matter of an exceptional
and extraordinary quality. Mr. Henley has
told us that in the vernacular, Burns, at his
best, touches the highest level; and with this
pronouncement nobody who knows the difference
between good writing and bad will
quarrel. But I do assert that the best of
Burns is not sufficient, either in quality or
quantity, to justify the absurd fame which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
has been bestowed upon him by his countrymen.
James I., whom the average Scotchman
barely knows by name, was, taking him
all in all, quite as good a poet as Burns. So
was Barbour; so was Drummond of Hawthornden;
and, I had almost added, so were
Stevenson and Robert Buchanan. The question
naturally arises, How comes it to pass
that Burns who, excepting by a fluke, was
always more or less of a middling poet, has
come to rank as the finest thing in letters
that Scotland ever produced? The answer
to that question is simple enough. In
spite of <cite>The Cotter’s Saturday Night</cite>, and two
or three other pieces which are the delight
and mainstay of the Scotch kirk-goer, Burns
was undoubtedly the poet of licence and alcoholism.
Also he was a ploughman.</p>

<p>After illicit love and flaring drunkenness,
nothing appeals so much to Scotch sentiment
as having been born in the gutter. In this
matter of admiration for people who attain
notoriety from a basis of humble origins I do
not know that the Scotch stand entirely
alone. At the present moment, much fuss
is being made in the newspapers over a
policeman who has seen fit to devote himself
to the painting of pictures, and who has succeeded
in getting one of his canvases hung at
Burlington House; and if I remember rightly
there used to be a postman poet of whom sundry
highly placed critics wrote sundry kindly
encouraging and gratuitous things. Also the
English press is apt to tell us that the great
Lord So-and-So was originally a bootblack,
and that the great Mr. So-and-So went to
Canada with seven shillings in his pocket. In
fact, the prodigy who began on nothing, and
ultimately became rich or famous, is a figure
which British humanity dearly loves. And
Burns, as we have seen, was a ploughman.
What special excellence may lie in being a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
ploughman nobody but a Scotchman may
perceive. In England our booms on humble
talent are of short duration. Clare and
Ebenezer Elliott both had their little day,
and ceased to be. But the Scotch ploughman
persists, and the fact that he was a
ploughman helps him to persist, and is a
great source of pride to the Scotch. The
real reason, however, why Burns became, and
continues to be, a sort of patron saint to the
peoples north of the Tweed is, as I have
already suggested, that he was an erotic
writer and a condoner of popular vices. Turn
where you will in his precious works, you will
find that drunkenness and impropriety are
matters for which he has unqualified sympathy.
Whiskey and women are the subjects
which furnish forth the majority of his
flights. He writes of both with a freedom
which would not nowadays be tolerated, and
the moral effect of what he has to say cannot
be regarded as otherwise than detrimental.
I have before pointed out that one of Mr.
Henley’s critics has asserted that the standard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of morality in the rural districts of Scotland
is much lower to-day than it was in
Burns’s time. The inference is obvious.
Burns, every Scotchman tells you, and tells
you truly, has played no small part in moulding
the sentiments and tendencies of the
Scotch people as we know them. It was he
who gave them their first notion of bumptious
independence; it was he who taught
them that “a man’s a man for a’ that”—which,
on the whole, is a monstrous fallacy;
it was he who averred that whiskey and freedom
gang together; and it was he who gave
the countenance of song to shameful and
squalid sexuality. In a great number of
Burns’s love songs the suggestion is of the
lowest. One could take a selection of these
songs, print them in a little book, have them
sold in the streets of London at a penny, and
be prosecuted at Bow Street for one’s trouble.
The man’s mind was not clean; he made the
Muse an instrument for the promulgation of
skulduddery (I will not vouch for the orthography,
but every Scotchman knows what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
mean); he degraded and prostituted his intellect,
and earned thereby the love and worship
of a people who appear to have a
sympathetic weakness for erotic verse if it
be but Scotch.</p>

<p>It is hard to get the truth about Burns out
of the Scotch writers; yet the more honest
among them have always had a sneaking suspicion
that he was an overrated poet. Somehow,
in perusing their estimates, one has a
feeling that Burns is not so much being expounded
as defended. Stevenson, who tried
to be just, has come nearer the mark about
him than any writer of our own time; but
even Stevenson lacked the courage to go the
whole hog. Of Burns, the writer, he could
be brought to say nothing more trenchant
than that he “had a tendency to borrow a
hint,” and that he was “indebted in a very
uncommon degree to Ramsay and Fergusson.”
And, he adds, by way of defence, that
“when we remember Burns’s obligation to
his predecessors, we must never forget his
immense advances on them.” Perhaps not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>As to Burns, the man, it is safe to say that
a more profligate person has seldom figured
on the slopes of Parnassus. In love he was
as carnal as he was false. He canted and
prated and pretended, but his relations with
women will not bear examination. His life
as a whole would have discredited a dustman,
much less a poet. He whined about his
“misfortunes,” and advertised them and
made much out of them; but nobody in his
senses can sympathise with him. That he
should be held up for a model by Scottish
writers and Scottish preachers is a crying
scandal. The king-o’-men cackle is the
sheerest impertinence. Burns never was the
king o’ men. He was never even a decent
living man. He never had a rag of conduct
wherewithal to cover himself. He was simply
an incontinent yokel with a gift for metricism.
That his memory should stand for
so much in Scotland constitutes a very grave
reflection upon the Scottish character and
the Scottish point of view.</p>

<h2 id="VIII">VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SCOT AS A CRITIC</span></h2>

<p>Taking him all in all, the Scotch critic is a
good deal of an anomaly. To criticise is
scarcely the Scotchman’s <i lang="la">forte</i>, his chief gifts
lying rather in the direction of admiration,
particularly of admiration for whatever is
Scotch. But we have amongst us (and I do
not wish him other than a long and prosperous
career) one Scotch critic—or, at any rate,
a Scotchman who passes for a critic. I
refer, need it be said, to Dr. William Archer.
Dr. Archer is the dramatic critic of the <cite>World</cite>
newspaper. Whenever I have looked into
the <cite>World</cite> newspaper, I have found a page or
so of Dr. Archer. His work appears to be
done to the satisfaction of his employers, and
I have no fault to find with it, excepting that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
I cannot bring myself to feel enthusiastic
about it. To tackle Dr. Archer flying, as it
were, let us peep at his contribution to the
current number of his journal. Herein he
deals with a play by Miss Netta Syrett and
preaches a little sermon to theatrical managers.</p>

<p>“I admit, then [he says], that from the
actor-manager’s point of view—his quite
legitimate and inevitable point of view under
our accursed system—the play has drawbacks
that might well stand in the way of its
production. But if any manager read it and
did not recognise that he was face to face
with an exceptional talent, and one of which,
by judicious encouragement, much might be
made, then I say that he showed a deplorable
lack of discernment. This—hypothetic—manager
ought to have sent for the authoress
and said, ‘Miss Syrett, I cannot, for such and
such reasons, produce this play. But there
are scenes in it which show me that you
have the making of a playwright in you.
Have you other ideas? Yes, of course you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
have. Well, go home and draw me out the
scenario of a play that you think would suit
me, and then come and let us talk it over.
Remember, I promise nothing, except my
very best attention to anything you may
bring me. But that you shall have; and if
you are not above taking hints from my experience,
you may be able to avoid certain
trifling errors and crudities into which you
have fallen in this piece. Don’t be in a hurry.
You ladies, if I may say so, are apt to imagine
that, when once you have got an idea, a
play can be improvised like a newspaper
article or a six shilling novel. This is a mistake.
A play, to have any solid value, must
be carefully and laboriously built up. You
will make false steps, find yourself in blind
alleys, and have to try back and start afresh
many and many a time. You will have days
of discouragement, when your characters refuse
point-blank to do what you want them
to. Probably you will find in the end that
you have given as much thought and labour
to every line of your play as you would to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
whole page of a novel. But if you are prepared
to take your art seriously, you may
rely upon my taking seriously whatever you
may offer me. And be assured of this, that
if you fail to do something really worth while,
my disappointment will be scarcely less than
your own.’ In some such words, as it seems
to me, should the sagacious manager have
addressed the authoress of <cite>The Finding of
Nancy</cite>.”</p>

<p>Excellently intended, my dear Dr. Archer,
excellently and honestly intended. But
could gratuitousness, or egregiousness, or
flat-footedness go further? Such an oration,
happily, might come out of none but a Scotch
mouth or from any pen but that of a Scotchman.
In point of unnecessariness it rivals
pretty well aught that I have had the felicity
to see in print. And it illustrates to admiration
the Scotch faculty for spreading out the
commonplace and being sententious over it.</p>

<p>What Dr. Archer’s view of the theatre may
be nobody knows. In the beginning of the
speech I have quoted he refers to “our accursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
system,” so that there must be a screw
loose somewhere. For years Dr. Archer has
been pounding away at this same system,
and it seems to continue. Nor has Dr.
Archer made the slightest dint upon it. A
little while back, one of the wags in which
London appears to abound pointed out that
plays praised by Dr. Archer invariably come
in for the shortest of runs. To which impeachment
Dr. Archer replied, with great
ingenuousness, by printing a formidable list
of plays which had survived his approval.
Another wag having said something against
the Scotch in a paper called <cite>The Outlook</cite>, Dr.
Archer exclaimed, in cold type, “<em>Outlook</em> indeed!
Methinks that north of the Tweed
they will call it <em>Outrage</em>!” This, of course,
is a Scotch joke, and therefore an old one.
In the year 600 or thereabouts, Gregory the
Great, noting the fair faces and golden hair
of some youths in the market-place of Rome,
enquired from what country the men came.
“They are Angles,” was the reply. “Not
<em>Angles</em>,” quoth the worthy Gregory, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
<em>angels</em>.” For thirteen centuries the pun of
the Bishop of Rome had remained decently
tucked away in the history books. And in
1901, Dr. Archer, who really is a wit, drags
it forth and makes another like it.</p>

<p>All these, however, be small deer. If we
wish to acquaint ourselves with the true inwardness
of Dr. Archer as critic, we must
turn to his <i lang="la">magnum opus</i>—that great guinea
work of his, entitled <cite>Poets of the Younger
Generation</cite>. Now, on the question of modern
poetry, and particularly of the younger
school of poets, people interested in poetry
are always glad to hear words of wisdom.
Have we any contemporary poets? If so,
are they writing poetry for us, contemporary
or otherwise? The subject invites. Somehow
and for some reason or other it invited
Dr. Archer. Indeed, it went further than
inviting him; it inveigled him. No doubt
the notion of writing a book about poets
came to him on one of his discouraging days.
He had been hammering, hammering, hammering
at the theatre and “our accursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
system,” and he was fain for a softer job.
What work could a poor, tired critic take up
outside the potter’s field of our accursed
system? When a critic gets into that frame
of mind he always thinks of the poets. Dr.
Archer thought of the poets—the living poets—the
poets of the younger generation. Being
a Scotchman, Dr. Archer thought, and
straightway set to work. He appears to
have plodded steadfastly through the writings
of no fewer than thirty-three of the
minor contemporary poets of England and
America. Of each of these thirty-three children
of the Muse, beginning with the Rev. H.
C. Beeching and ending with William Butler
Yeats, he wrote painful notices, bejewelled
with excerpts, put them into a book, and
got them published by Mr. John Lane. With
the beauty or otherwise of his thirty-three
notices, in spite of their exquisite thirty-three-ness,
I do not propose greatly to concern
myself. Their general drift and tenor
may be inferred from the following examples,
culled from the article on Mr. Kipling:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Far be it from me to disparage <cite>Scots Wha
Hae</cite>, but I am not sure that it possesses the
tonic quality of the refrain of Mr. Kipling’s
song of defeat:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">An’ there ain’t no chorus ’ere to give,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nor there ain’t no band to play;</div>
<div class="verse">But I wish I was dead ’fore I done what I did</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Or seen what I’d seed that day!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What in the name of goodness have <cite>Scots
Wha Hae</cite> and these four lines got to do with
one another? How can they be compared,
except only as verse, and where, oh where,
does the tonic quality of the Kipling lines
come in? Again:</p>

<p>“In all the poetry of warfare, was there
ever a more exactly observed and yet imaginative
touch than that which describes the
guns of the enemy ‘shaking their bustles like
ladies so fine’? It is grotesque, and it is
magnificent.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact it is not observed at all,
and it is certainly not magnificent. Ladies
do not shake their bustles. Nowadays, indeed,
they have no bustles to shake, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
should imagine that the sound criticism
about the simile is that it is too temporary
and far fetched. And for the third and last
time:</p>

<p>“Only by some narrow trick of definition
can such work (<cite>McAndrew’s Hymn</cite>) be excluded
from the sphere of poetry; and poetry
or no poetry, it is certainly very strong and
vital literature.”</p>

<p>Here let us agree to differ with Dr. Archer,
inasmuch as <cite>McAndrew’s Hymn</cite> is merely
rhymed note-book eked out with a few
phrases of the Doric.</p>

<p>On the whole, <cite>Poets of the Younger Generation</cite>
might well have gone down to posterity
as a collection of middling and slightly
wrong-headed reviews, had Dr. Archer possessed
a tithe of the shrewdness commonly
imputed to persons of his blood. But in
putting the book before the world, Dr.
Archer could not be content to figure as a
simple reviewer, he must needs preface it
with a pompous and bloated introduction.
“Appreciation [he says nobly] is the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and aim of the following pages. The verb
‘to appreciate’ is used, rightly or wrongly,
in two senses; it sometimes means to realise,
at other times to enhance the value of a
thing. I use the word in both significations.
While attempting to define, to appraise, the
talent of individual poets, I hope to enhance
the reader’s estimate of the value of contemporary
poetry as a whole.” After several
pages of this sort of thing we come upon a
full-dress “personal statement,” the like of
which has never before been given us by
mortal critic. Practically, it is a biography
of Dr. William Archer, with special reference
to Dr. William Archer’s spiritual and intellectual
growth and his “qualifications as a
critic of poetry.” The pose and tone of it
are inimitable. It puts Burns and his “wild
artless notes” utterly to the blush. As Dr.
Archer himself would say, it is grotesque and
it is magnificent. It begins with a rataplan
on ancestral drums: “In the first place, I am
a pure bred Scotchman. There is some
vague family legend of an ancestor of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
father’s having come from England with
Oliver Cromwell and settled in Glasgow;
but I never could discover any evidence
of it. The only thing that speaks in its favour
is that my name, common in England,
is uncommon in Scotland. My maternal
grandfather and grandmother both came of
families that seem to have dwelt from time
immemorial in and about Perth, at the gateway
of the Highlands. This being so, it appears
very improbable that there should not
be some Keltic admixture in my blood; but
I cannot absolutely lay my finger on any
‘Mac’ among my forbears. Both my parents
belong to families of a deeply religious cast of
mind, ultra-orthodox in dogma, heterodox and
even vehemently dissenting on questions of
Church Government. I can trace some way
back in my mother’s family a strain of good,
sound, orthodox literary culture and taste; of
specially poetical faculty, little or none. It
may, perhaps, be worth mentioning that one
of my great-grandfathers or great-great-uncles
printed—and I believe, edited—an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
edition of the poets, much esteemed in its
day.”</p>

<p>Nothing could be better worth mentioning,
Mr. Archer. Pray proceed:</p>

<p>“The earliest symptom I can find in myself
that can possibly be taken as showing
any marked relation to the poetic side of life,
is an extreme susceptibility (very clearly inherited
from my father) to simple, pathetic
music. It is related that even in my infancy,
one special tune—the <cite>Adeste Fideles</cite>—if so
much as hummed in my neighbourhood,
would always make me howl lustily; and,
indeed, to this day it seems to me infinitely
pathetic. I have carried through life, without
any sort of musical gift, and with a very
imperfect apprehension of tonality, harmony,
and the refinements and complexities of
musical expression, this keen sensibility to
the emotional effect of certain lovely rhythms
and simple curves of notes. I am not sure
that <cite lang="it">Lascia ch’ie pranga, Che faer farò senza
Euridice</cite>, and the cantabile in Chopin’s <cite>Funeral
March</cite>, do not seem to me the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
divinest utterances of the human spirit, before
which all the achievements of all the
poets fade and grow dim. But it is all one
to me (or very nearly so) whether they are
reeled off on a barrel organ or performed by
the greatest singers—the finest orchestra.
Nay, my own performance of them, in
the silent chamber concerts of memory,
are enough to bring the tears to my
eyes.”</p>

<p>Good man!</p>

<p>“I cannot remember that the poetry I
learned at school interested or pleased me
particularly—‘On Linden, when the sun was
low,’ ‘FitzJames was brave, yet to his
heart,’ ‘The Assyrian came down like the
wolf on the fold,’ and so forth.… The
first composition of mine that ever found its
way into print was some sort of a rhapsody
(in prose) on Byron at Missolonghi. The
attack passed off in six months or so, and I
am not aware that it left behind any permanent
ill effects. At the same time I read the
greater part of <cite>The Faerie Queene</cite> with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
certain pleasure, but without any real appreciation.”</p>

<p>Wordsworth this remarkable youth “read
for a college essay”; “Coleridge came to him
in the train of Wordsworth”; and at seventeen
<cite>The Ancient Mariner</cite> seemed to him
“the most magical of poems.” Tennyson he
read “with pleasure”; Keats “had not yet
taken hold” of him; and Milton he “could
not read.” Ultimately, however, he came to
appreciate Milton in this wise. “I spent my
twentieth year idling in Australia, and, being
somewhat hard up for literature, I set myself
to read <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> from beginning to end,
at the rate of a book a day. I accomplished
the task, but it bored me unspeakably.…
I did not return to it for seven or eight years,
until one day I found myself starting on a
railway journey with nothing to read, and
paid a shilling at a station bookstall for a
pocket <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>.” On that journey the
scales fell from Dr. Archer’s eyes. Ever
since, <cite>Paradise Lost</cite> has been to him “an inexhaustible
mine of the pure gold of poetry.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Later, we learn that Dr. Archer’s own metrical
efforts have been “almost entirely confined
to comic, or, at any rate, journalistic,
verse,” though he “never attained even the
fluency of the practised newspaper rhymester.”
Greek and Latin verses, he adds,
“were undreamt of in the Scottish curriculum
of my day. Practically we knew not
what quantity meant.”</p>

<p>Altogether, therefore, Dr. William Archer’s
“qualifications as a critic of poetry” would
seem to be, on his own showing, of a negative
rather than a positive order. He is a pure
bred Scotchman; he may have a little English
blood in him, but he has not been able
to trace it; he is without any sort of musical
gift; he likes his music “reeled off on a barrel
organ”; poetry had no charms for him
till he was seventeen; and he did not discover
Milton’s “inexhaustible mine of the
pure gold of poetry” till he was twenty-seven
or twenty-eight years of age. Also at his
college they “did not know what quantity
meant.” Yet at the age of forty-three he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
had “ready for press” five hundred pages of
appreciations of poets of the younger generation.
It is truly marvellous and prodigiously
Scotch. And it sets one wondering.
At what epoch in his extraordinary life did
Dr. Archer begin to take a critical interest in
the drama? Was he shovelled into that interest
by the exigencies of his work on newspapers,
or did it come to him, like his love of
Milton, on a railway journey? Furthermore,
how many of his brither Scots, who labour so
solemnly in the vineyard of literary journalism
and plume themselves on their “pull” in
contemporary letters, are of the like origins
and possess the same disqualifications as Dr.
William Archer? I doubt if one per cent. of
them is really competent. I know for a fact
that ninety per cent. of them are absolutely
devoid of taste, much less of understanding
and vision, and that they exercise critical
functions not because they have insight or
feeling for literature, but because “a living”
and certain petty powers are to be had out of
it. The much vaunted “Scotch pull” in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
criticism is without doubt the worst trouble
that has ever assailed English letters. In a
great measure it has been responsible for the
general slackening and stodginess which have
overtaken the whole business during the past
decade or so. Persons who write, not to
mention persons who read, know full well
that at the present time criticism is well nigh
a dead letter in this country. Reviews are
no longer taken seriously either by authors
or the public; the literary papers languish,
depending, for such revenue as they possess,
upon publishers’ advertisements instead of
upon circulation; literary opinion has been
fined down to sheer puff on the one hand and
flagrant abuse or neglect on the other, and to
be the friend or admiring acquaintance of
certain persons is become the only sure road
to literary advancement. It is the fashion to
say that nobody, however ill-disposed, can
stop the sale of a good book, or keep the author
of such a book out of his meed of recognition.
In the long result this is true. But
waiting for the long result is a weary business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
particularly when you discover that there is
an inclination on the part of the people who
have “the pull” to put the clock back for you
at every turn; what time they boom the
work of their “ain folk” and shout loudly
and insistently for catch-penny mediocrity.
This, by the way, is not in any sense a “sore-head”
asseveration; because my own writings
have, as a rule, been of so slender a
nature that I have marvelled to see them
noticed at all. Besides, I do not think that
I am without friends even among the apostles
of the “Scotch pull.” They have done me
many a service, and with a lively sense of
favours to come I hereby offer them gratitude.
All the same, I should not be sorry to
see them disbanded. I should not be sorry
to hear that never a one of them was to be
permitted again to set pen to paper in the
capacity of reviewer. Literary journalism
would be all the sweeter and saner for such a
closure, and judging by the rates of payment
they take, the “Scotch pull” combination
would be very little the poorer.</p>

<h3>NOTE<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></h3>

<p>The Scots opinion of Burns may perhaps
be best illustrated by quoting a Burns-Night
oration. The speech appended below may
be taken as a moderate sample of what
Burns’s admirers are in the habit of saying
about him. I am indebted to Dr. Ross’s
volume, <cite>Henley on Burns</cite>, for the excerpt:
“Burns suffered more from remorse and genuine
penitence than probably any man who
ever lived. Not only so, but the very bitterness
of his cry, ‘God be merciful to me a
sinner,’ has been seized upon by his calumniators,
and used as a weapon to stab him
behind his back. But leave Burns to his
Maker, and, keeping in view the parable of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the Pharisee and the publican, it is just possible,
nay probable, that those who talk so
glibly about the sins of Burns may find at
the great day of reckoning that the penitent
poet and the penitent publican are justified
rather than they. There are certain classes
of people who must always look upon Burns
with doubt and suspicion. Many decent,
worthy people, naturally and properly disliking
the clay, miss the gold. Many worthy
teetotallers dislike the poet on account of his
drinking songs; but even they are beginning
to forgive him for writing <cite>Willie brewed a
peck o’ maut</cite> and such like. The Pharisee
and the hypocrite, throughout their generations,
will always dislike him, not because of
his sins, but on account of his satires:</p>

<p>“Ay, Burns is like a great mountain, based
on earth, towering towards heaven—of a
mixed character, containing gold, silver,
brass, iron, and clay, and from which every
man, according to his taste, can become enriched
by the gold and the silver, or get mired
in the clay. All that is best in Burns (and that
is nearly the whole) will remain a precious
possession with the Anglo-Saxon race in the
ages yet to come. The Stars and Stripes of
our cousins across the sea—the great American
people—will ere long float side by side
with the grand old flag that for a thousand
years has braved the battle and the breeze.
And the Bible and Burns will lie side by side
in the homes of the reunited Anglo-Saxon
race,—the freest, bravest, and most liberty-loving
people the world ever saw or shall
see.”</p>

<p>It will be noted that herein Burns is made
out to be an honest fellow who went wrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
only at times; also the mire in him is a small
detail, his best being nearly the whole of him;
also that in the glorious days to come, when
the Anglo-Saxon races shall have fused into
one great people, Burns and the Bible are to
be our great literary and ethical standby.</p>

<p>As indicating the kind of abuse that the
Scot is in the habit of levelling at persons
who disagree with him as to Burns, I likewise
print a set of verses aimed at Mr. Henley by
one of Dr. Ross’s scarifiers:</p>

<p>The author of this effusion must have
known perfectly well that Mr. Henley would
have written just as he has written, if Burns
had been alive. The suggestion that “he
couldna reach me, and I didna heed,” is
purely gratuitous and foolish.</p>

<h2 id="IX">IX<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SCOT AS BIOGRAPHER</span></h2>

<p>There are two Scotch books of biography,
all published, I believe, within the last six
years, which invariably raise my gorge. One
of them is <cite>Margaret Ogilvy</cite>, by Dr. J. M.
Barrie; the second is <cite>J. M. Barrie and his
Books</cite>, by Dr. J. A. Hammerton. The first,
dealing with a dead mother, is a work that
nothing but a sense of duty could induce me
to handle in the present connection. It has,
however, been put before the public without
so much as an attempt at justification or
apology, and with the plain intention of being
sold precisely in the manner of other literary
wares, and it must therefore take its chance.
<cite>Margaret Ogilvy</cite> appears to have gone into
no end of editions. It is an account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
character and sayings of Dr. J. M. Barrie’s
mother, viewed in the light of Dr. Barrie’s
own “literaryness.” I have no hesitation in
pronouncing it to be one of the most snobbish
books that have issued from the press
any time this hundred years. It begins
snobbishly, it goes on snobbishly, and it ends
snobbishly. Offered to the reading public as
a piece of fictional sentiment, it would still
have been open to the charge of mawkishness.
Offered unblushingly as a transcript
from the life and for the perusal of all who
care to purchase, deplorable is the mildest
epithet one can justly apply to it. Wordsworth
writes somewhere of a person “who
would peep and botanise about his mother’s
grave.” This is exactly the feeling that a
reading of <cite>Margaret Ogilvy</cite> gives you. Comparisons
in such a case would be doubly odious.
Yet one does not find that Margaret
Ogilvy, in spite of everything that her son
has done for her in the way of “keying-up” to
literary requirements, was any the sweeter, or
any the nobler, or any the more intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
than one may presume the mother of any
other writer of Dr. Barrie’s parts to have
been. She was a good mother, she gave
birth to Dr. Barrie, she ministered to him in
childhood, she denied herself for him; she
took pleasure in his educational and literary
progress, she offered him much advice; she
believed in “God” and “love,” and she died
in the faith. The mothers of most literary
people have done as much. It has been left
to Dr. Barrie to snatch away the decent veil
which hides the sanctities of life from the
common gaze, and to let all the world into
the privacies of the filial and maternal relation
at five shillings a time. If I understand
Margaret Ogilvy aright, she would have cut
off both her hands rather than permit some
of the things in this book to become the property
of strangers, sympathetic or otherwise.</p>

<p>Of course, the excuse immediately forthcoming
from Dr. Barrie’s friends and admirers
will be “the lesson.” It is the only
excuse that can possibly be raked up, and,
like the majority of excuses, it is a poor stick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to lean upon. For “the lesson” of <cite>Margaret
Ogilvy</cite> simply amounts to this, that conceit
and self-advertisement may bring a man to
the silliest and least dignified of passes. In
point of fact Dr. Barrie’s “little study” is
just as much a study of himself as of his
mother. If it shows Margaret Ogilvy in the
figure of an excellent mother, it also shows
J. M. Barrie in the figure of a preternaturally
excellent and dutiful son. If it shows that
Margaret Ogilvy was a simple, unsophisticated
woman of the people, it shows also that
J. M. Barrie had compassion on her intellectual
shortcomings and was ever ready to humour
the poor body and to twinkle tolerantly
on her whimsies, when he might, had he so
chosen, have withered her with a word. To
take a sample passage: “Now that I was an
author, I must get into a club. But you
should have heard my mother on clubs! She
knew of none save those to which you subscribe
a pittance weekly, and the London
clubs were her scorn. Often I heard her on
them—she raised her voice to make me hear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
whichever room I might be in, and it was
when she was sarcastic that I skulked the
most: ‘Thirty pounds is what he will have
to pay the first year, and ten pounds a year
after that. You think it’s a lot o’ siller?
Oh, no, you’re mista’en—it’s nothing ava’.
For the third part of thirty pounds you could
rent a four-roomed house, but what is a four-roomed
house, what is thirty pounds, compared
to the glory of being a member of a
club?’ … My wisest policy was to remain
downstairs when these withering blasts
were blowing, but probably I went up in
self-defence.</p>

<p>“‘I never saw you so pugnacious before,
mother.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh,’ she would reply, promptly, ‘you
canna expect me to be sharp in the uptake
when I am no’ a member of a club.’</p>

<p>“‘But the difficulty is in becoming a member.
They are very particular about whom
they elect, and I daresay I shall not get in.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, I’m but a poor crittur (not being
member of a club), but I think I can tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to make your mind easy on that head. You’ll
get in, I’se uphaud—and your thirty pounds
will get in, too.’”</p>

<p>And so on. Humour, of course! The
sagacious, garrulous mother, the highly diverted,
patient son! The picture has pleased
the Scotch and English-speaking nations of
two hemispheres. Yet is it of the stupidest
and the most foolish.</p>

<p>On another page we get the following
pretty piece of curtain lifting: ‘So my
mother and I go up the stair together. ‘We
have changed places,’ she says; ‘that was
just how I used to help you up, but I’m the
bairn now.’ She brings out the Testament
again; it was always lying within reach.…
And when she has read for a long time she
‘gives me a look,’ as we say in the North, and
I go out, to leave her alone with God.…
Often and often I have found her on her
knees, but I always went softly away, closing
the door. I never heard her pray, but I
know very well how she prayed, and that,
when that door was shut, there was not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
day in God’s sight between the worn woman
and the little child.’</p>

<p>We can do without such books, Dr. J. M.
Barrie, even though they sell well.</p>

<p>Even as Dr. Archer has discovered in <cite>Paradise
Lost</cite> an inexhaustible mine of the pure
gold of poetry, so have I found in Dr. J. A.
Hammerton’s <cite>J. M. Barrie and his Books</cite> an
inexhaustible fund of the pure gold of Scotch
opinion not only as to Dr. Barrie, but also
as to other matters. First let me string together
a few pearls about Dr. Barrie.</p>

<p>“I have seen it argued [says our excellent
author] that the publication of such a book
as this is a reprehensible practice [<i lang="la">sic</i>], in that
it implies the elevation of its subject to the
rank of a classic.… A sufficient answer
to this charge would seem to be that in such
writers as J. M. Barrie, Thomas Hardy, ‘Ian
Maclaren,’ Rudyard Kipling, and several
others [<i lang="la">sic</i>], the public that reads books is
vastly more interested than it is in its mighty
dead.”</p>

<p>The collocation of “such writers” in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
passage is as ingenious as it is absurdly
Scotch.</p>

<p>“Among the literary men of the present
day there is none who has been more personal
in his writings than Dr. Barrie; he is
as personal in prose as Byron was in poetry.
His own heart, his own experiences, the lives
of his ‘ain folk,’ these have been the subjects
out of which <em>his genius has made literature</em>.”</p>

<p>The italics are our own.</p>

<p>“The main distinction of Nottingham
journalism lies in the fact that it is associated
with the name of Dr. J. M. Barrie.…
To-day the so-called ‘Press House’ is a tavern
a few yards removed from the ‘Frying
Pan,’ and there penny-a-liners and half-fledged
reporters drink beer and fancy themselves
full-blown journalists, carrying down
the traditions of Billy Kirker and that bright
Bohemian band. But there are no Barries
among them.”</p>

<p>Nottingham, evidently, is in a parlous way.</p>

<p>“It is well known that Dr. Barrie’s start
was like that of so many others who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
won their way to greatness in the Republic
of Letters: a brief spell of journalism, and
then—the plunge into literature.”</p>

<p>One can hear Dr. Barrie splashing about
for dear life.</p>

<p>“It had never occurred to him [Barrie]
that his task lay so near his hand; that to
turn the lives of his fellow-townsmen into
literature was the way that God had chosen
for him to make the age to come his own.”</p>

<p>I should think not, indeed!</p>

<p>“In Barrie’s case it was comparatively a
short struggle, and two or three years after
the time when he found that Scots dialect
was enough to damn a book, he had succeeded
in making it an attraction; presently
its charm became the most striking feature
of contemporary letters, and what we may
call the Barrie school arose to accomplish
feats unique in the literary history of the
nineteenth century.”</p>

<p>Prodigious!</p>

<p>“Sydney Smith was witty; so, too, was
Sheridan; Dickens was a humourist; Hood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
like Barrie, was at once a wit and a humourist.”</p>

<p>Who would have thought it?</p>

<p>“The noblest book which Barrie has given
to the world is none other than <cite>Margaret
Ogilvy</cite>, in which—to use the vile and vulgar
phrase—he has made ‘copy’ of his mother.…
If he had done nothing more than
draw that sweet picture of a good woman’s
humble, happy life, he would have deserved
well of his generation. It was a delicate,
almost an impossible, task to take up, and
only an artist of the first order could have
dared to hope for success in it.… There
is no passage in all that Barrie has written
more essentially Scottish in character than
the delightfully humorous account of his
mother on the prospect of his election to a
well-known London club, for which he had
been nominated by the good fairy of his literary
life—Frederick Greenwood.”</p>

<p>Most interesting and most illuminating.
Now for Dr. Hammerton on smaller matters.
He assures us that “if one will only read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
anecdotes of village ‘loonies’ with which
Scots literature abounds—especially Dean
Ramsay’s <cite>Reminiscences</cite> and <cite>The Laird o’
Logan</cite>—he will find that the average Scots
idiot was a creature of considerably more
humour than the average Englishman”—which
is a palpable hit. Also, “Only once
have I felt inclined to wince in reading anything
of Barrie’s, and that was one chapter
entitled, ‘Making the Best of it,’ in <cite>A Window
in Thrums</cite>; for here it seemed to me he was
dwelling on an unworthy element of character
which is more typical of the English rural
and working classes than of the Scots. I
mean the flattering of wealthy fools with a
view to largess.”</p>

<p>Dr. Hammerton is quite amusing. His
notion of the tremendousness of Dr. Barrie
and of the vast superiority of the Scotch does
him credit. One day, perhaps, he will wake
up to the fact that Dr. Barrie is not among
the persons who write literature. And even
though Dr. Hammerton should never realise
it, the fact remains.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SCOT IN LETTERS</span></h2>

<p>Dr. Archer was once at pains to prove
that his countrymen had contributed “at
least their share” of good works to the main
stream of English literature. Dr. Archer did
this with the help, I believe, of an anthology
by Mr. Henley. Properly wielded, an anthology
is an excellent weapon, inasmuch as
you can prove almost anything out of it. In
the supposition that Scotland has done admirably
by letters, Dr. Archer has the support
of a large body of Scotchmen. For my
own part I am quite ready to admit that she
has done her best. What a poor best that
is, everybody is aware, though so far as I
know it is now for the first time set forth
in print. When one comes to look upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
English literature in the mass, beginning with
Chaucer and coming down to Tennyson, and
dealing only with the larger forces which
have gone to the production of it, one perceives
at once that Scotland’s share in the
matter has been so small as to be scarcely
worth counting. Against Chaucer, perhaps,
she can place James I., but the difference is
as the difference between chalk and cheese.
Against Shakespeare and the Elizabethan
dramatists she has nothing to show you,
good, bad, or indifferent. Against Milton I
suppose she will offer you Drummond of
Hawthornden, and for Shelley and Keats,
Burns. And of course she vaunts herself
on Scott and Carlyle, and takes a certain
haughty pride in the fact that R. L. Stevenson
was Scotch.</p>

<p>To James I. and Drummond of Hawthornden
she is welcome; both of them are what
may be termed tolerable poets, and there the
matter ends. Of Burns and his work I have
already given my view, but I would say here
that while at the present moment his popularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
is of the widest and has all the appearances
of stability, the circumstance that he
wrote in a vernacular must ultimately relegate
him to a position of comparative obscurity.
As Scotland gradually extricates
herself from the sloughs of barbarism in
which she wallows so joyfully, she will inevitably
shed her uncouth dialect, and, as
soon as that is accomplished, Burns, excepting
as a curiosity, will no longer exist.</p>

<p>For Scott and Carlyle little need be said.
Both, I believe, have had their day. Scott,
erstwhile the Wizard of the North, is rapidly
dropping out of public favour. At the present
moment he is what may be styled “a
school-prize classic.” <cite>Ivanhoe</cite> and <cite>The Lady
of the Lake</cite>, once considered to be marvellous
performances, are now doled out to grubby
children for punctual attendance at board
schools. In the libraries, public and private,
Scott, of course, figures, but the public library
statistics go to indicate that he is not being
read with avidity, and in private libraries
he is felt to be rather a cumberer of space.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Talking to a well-known Scotch critic as to
the general decay of interest in Scott, I found
him to be under no illusion on the point, and
he electrified me by saying, “Scott—well, of
course! But between ourselves, man, I cannot
read the d⸺ books.” This is pretty
well everybody’s case. To avow that you
have not read Scott is still, perhaps, to confess
to a defect in your reading. All the
same, if you are a person of average tendencies,
you have not read Scott, neither do you
propose to do so.</p>

<p>Thomas Carlyle—“true Thomas” as Dr.
Archer pathetically dubs him—is another
Scotch rocket which has already touched its
highest and begun to descend. Both intellectually
and as an artist Carlyle, it is true,
was worth a dozen Scotts, but he was a
Scotchman, and come as near it as he may, a
Scotchman cannot do enduring work. So
that Carlyle, in the natural order of things, is,
as one might say, dropping down the ladder
rung by rung. He has ceased to be a “force.”
People have discovered that his so-called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
gospel is a somewhat cheap and snobbish
affair. All that is really left of him is <cite>The
French Revolution</cite>, which survives because of
a certain vividness of style. For the rest,
Carlyle looks like going to pieces. A century
hence he will be of no more account than
Christopher North is to-day.</p>

<p>As to Stevenson, while the Scotch are disposed
to brag about him when occasion
arises, they have always fought more or less
shy of him. He has never been admitted to
that cordial intimacy of relation which a
Scotchman extends alike to Robbie Burns
and Dr. R. S. Crockett. As a matter of fact,
he wrote too well and with too sincere a regard
for the finer elements of literature to
be properly understood in Scotland. Further,
he took the precaution not to interlard
his English with such phrases as “ben the
hoose,” “getting a wee doited,” and so forth.
He had no use for Scotch idioms, and when
he dropped into them he was sorry for it.
And he did not stiffen his pages with
panegyric of the Scotch character. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Stevenson tacitly refused to have anything
to do with the advertising of his countrymen.
He had the good sense to perceive that if you
are to use the English language as a medium
for expression, you might as well use it skilfully
and decently while you are about it.
More than all, he did not boast of having been
born in a wynd, or of having pu’d fine gowans
wi’ Jeanie, the auld sweetie wife’s dochter
at Drumkettle.</p>

<p>And an author—a modern author—who is
guilty of all these sins of commission and
omission must not expect perfection from the
warm heart of Scotia. Somehow the Scotch
seem to be a nation of persons without
fathers. Nearly every Scot one meets strikes
one as being a first generation man. You
know instinctively, even if he does not tell you,
that in his childhood he ran about with untended
nose and called his mother “mither.”
Even after he has been to “the college,” and
made some progress in the business or profession
to which he may have devoted himself,
he clings to his squalid origins and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
manners of his forbears for dear life. He is
the barbarian who scorns to be tamed. The
tradition of Scottish independence demands
that he should keep you well posted in the
facts as to his humble descent and upbringing,
and that he should go on speaking as
much of his heaven-forsaken dialect as you
will let him. To such a person a Scot of the
Stevenson type does not appeal. Stevenson,
of course, was a Scot, and meet to be bragged
about as a successful Scot. For all that he
was not a “brither Scot.” He took to the
English way and the English manner, and
the brither Scots as a body had no alternative
but to turn a sour face towards him. From
the literary point of view, though he accomplished
great things, R. L. S. is just another
instance of the ultimate ineptitude of the
Scotchman. He tried and tried and tried.
No writer of our time has had nobler ideals.
Yet he could not climb after his desire. His
books are a procession of worthy and even
splendid failures. The Scotchness of his
blood, do what he might to eradicate it, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
too much for him. It kept him from attaining
the highest.</p>

<p>To treat of the new school of Scottish
writers in the present chapter is, perhaps, to
do them too much honour. At no period in
the history of letters has such flagrantly bad
writing been offered to the English public as
is being at present offered by our Scottish
authors. Their works have been boomed
into a vogue which they do not deserve, and
even Scotchmen admit that their so-called
transcripts from life are as false and as
shoddy as such transcripts well could be.
Writing on this subject, Mr. R. B. Cunninghame,
himself a Scot, says: “If it pleases
them (the hoot-awa’-man gang) to represent
that half of the population of their native
land is imbecile, the fault is theirs. But for
the idiots, the precentors, elders of churches,
the ‘select men,’ and those landward folk
who have been dragged of late into publicity,
I compassionate them, knowing their language
has been distorted, and they themselves
been rendered such abject snivellers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that not a hen wife, shepherd, ploughman, or
any one who thinks in ‘guid braid Scots’
would recognise himself dressed in the motley
which it has been the pride of kailyard
writers to bestow. Neither would I have
Englishmen believe that the entire Scotch
nation is composed of ministers, elders, and
maudlin whiskified physicians, nor even of
precentors who are employed in Scotland to
put the congregation out by starting hymns
on the wrong note, or in a key impossible for
any but themselves to compass.” Mr. Cunninghame
ought to know.</p>

<p>The other day I saw in a paper, edited, of
course, by a Scotchman, a reference to
“many contemporary Scottish men of letters.”
I do not hesitate to assert that the
number of Scottish men of letters now living
can be counted twice on the fingers of one
hand. Indeed, with the persons who might
be expected to count in such a category, in
my mind’s eye, I have difficulty in admitting
that any one of them is a man of letters in
the strict sense of the phrase. Even Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
Andrew Lang, who is by far the most competent
Scotchman now writing, would probably
not care to lay claim to the dignity
which the term “men of letters” suggests.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SCOT IN COMMERCE</span></h2>

<p>When a Scotchman’s parents decide that
he shall be neither a minister nor a journalist,
or when a wee laddie who has been dedicated
to one or other of these offices kicks over
the traces, or turns out something of a failure,
there are still splendid openings for him.
Far away to the south stretches that land of
milk and honey—“England”—and there is
scarcely a square mile of it whereon you do
not find either a shop or a bank or a factory,
or some other hive of industry created, of
course, for the special benefit of Scotchmen.
Donald, the hobbledehoy, that would not be
a minister, and was not intended for a professor,
and had not shorthand enough to be
a journalist, is packed off South to wear an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
apron, to shovel gold behind bars, or “to
work his way up” in an engineering establishment,
as the case may be. Furthermore,
he is understood to make an excellent gardener,
and not a few English noblemen like to
keep him about their places weeding and
pruning, and feeding hogs. In the main,
however, he rather tends to become a clerk
in an office. There is something about being
able to keep your coat on while you work and
to be in the confidence of Mr. Foozlem’s
books,—of holding, in short, a “position of
trust,” at thirty shillings a week, which is
peculiarly attractive to the Scottish mind;
and employers of clerical labour appear to be
firmly convinced that Donald is the man for
them. They like him because he is never
late, he is always putting a bit by, and he is
as cheap as horseflesh. His slowness and
want of sagacity are no great matter. The
fact that he can only work in grooves also
does not matter. Thrift and punctuality,
not to mention cheapness, clothe him with
virtues like a garment, and when higher posts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
fall vacant, your employer—good, easy man—has
a way of turning a hopeful eye on
“that steady young Scot.” The late remarkable
case of Mr. Goudie, who was as
Scotch as you make them, and, perhaps, the
greatest and stupidest rogue that has adorned
the annals of modern banking, shows what a
Scotch clerk can do when he tries. The genius
of his country asserted itself in the matter
of Mr. Goudie, and we saw what we saw. In
banks, at any rate, to be Scotch will not be
to rank with Cæsar’s wife for quite a little
time to come. Of course, we shall be told
that the raking up of Goudie is unfair. It
always is unfair to say anything to the detriment
of Scotchmen. But the point I wish
to insist upon is that Scotch clerks and
Scotch managers and Scotchmen at large are
no more trustworthy and no more to be
depended upon and no less human than
Englishmen. The Scotch themselves spare
no effort to have it believed that if you want
men of true probity, you must go to Scotland
for them. Employers have taken them at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
their word and continue to take them at
their word, and, all other things being equal,
if there are two applicants for a position in
the average commercial house, and one of
them is English and the other Scotch, the
Scotchman gets the preference, simply because
he is Scotch.</p>

<p>Among Dr. Maclaren’s Drumtochty marvels,
there is an old couple who have a son
who is a professor. That son, being, of
course, a model of what a son should be,
writes home to his good mother once a week,
and the letter is invariably forthcoming in
the kirkyard on Sundays, so that all who care
to read may be informed as to the professor’s
condition and progress. Many touching
things are said by the admirers of this honest
couple as to the honour their son has conferred
upon “the Glen,” and the general prodigiousness
of his character and position.
But it never occurs to Dr. Maclaren to put
into the mouth of any of his people a single
word as to what is thought of the professor
by the persons with whom he is dealing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
What do his fellow professors think of him?
What do his students think of him? We all
know that professor from Drumtochty, and
we all wish that Drumtochty had kept him.
Not only in universities, but wherever there
is a modest living to be made, there you will
find him in full bloom, and the more authority
he has, the less possible is he to get on
with. As a colleague, too, he is equally
objectionable. When a certain Scotch lady
was informed during the time of the Indian
Mutiny that her son had been captured by
the enemy with other prisoners and that he
had been put into a chain-gang, she said with
emotion, “God help the man that’s chained
to oor Sandy.” And this is precisely the
trouble. To work amicably with a Scotchman
in any commercial capacity is well nigh
an impossibility. He is eaten up with
a squint-eyed envy; the fear that for some
inscrutable reason you wish to oust him
out of his occupation is ever with him, and
it is part of his creed and code to shoulder
out any fellow worker who happens to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
getting a little more money or a little more
credit than himself. In fact, when he comes
to take up any sort of a berth, it is with the
consciousness that, as a Scot, it is his duty by
hook or by crook to make himself master of
the situation, and, if needs be, to turn out in
the long run his own employer. If you ask
a Scotchman how it comes to pass that so
many of his compatriots hold positions of influence
in commercial houses, he will reply,
nine times out of ten, “Well, you see, we just
drop into them.” If this were so, nobody
would mind, but as a matter of fact, your
Scotchman is far too calculating to drop into
anything. His great game is the game of
grab; he will move heaven and earth to get
what he wants, and, as Dr. Robertson Nicoll
has told us, he is not over-scrupulous in his
methods of getting it. Every commercial
man could give instances of this over-reachingness
which is such an essential feature of
the policy of the Scotch employee. Live and
let live is not at all in his way. Of gratitude
for help rendered he knows nothing. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
begins life with sycophancy, and the moment
he meets with any sort of success, he assumes
a truculent over-bearingness which he is
pleased to call force of character. When you
hear of men being deprived of their positions
by sharp practice and shiftiness, no matter
whether it be in a draper’s shop or in a gilt-edged
bank, you will find that nine times out
of ten there is a Scotchman in the case; that
it is the Scotchman who has got up the
bother, and that it is the Scotchman who is
to take the post the other man vacates. Dr.
Nicoll, who is a veritable encyclopædia of
Scotch character, wrote some time ago a
number of articles which he called <cite>Firing out
the Fools</cite>. He asserted very properly that in
most business houses there are always a number
of fools who are a dead weight on progress.
The capable men who are not quite
capable enough are the plague of most heads
of commercial concerns. You want a man to
do such and such things; you look round
your staff; you consider the merits of this
and that person, and you feel that none of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
them is exactly the person you want. What
are you to do? If you endeavour to get a
man from outside, the chances are that he
will be no better than the men you have.
Dr. Nicoll, of course, knows exactly what
you should do. He does not say, “Send for
the nearest Scotchman,” because that would
be a little too explicit; but he does say that
plod is the great quality which distinguishes
competence from foolishness, and, as everybody
knows, the Scot is nothing if not a
plodder. Plod, plod, plod, with plenty of
divagations into plotting and scheming, is the
essence of his life. And when all is said and
done, plod may be counted about the meanest
and least desirable of the virtues. It is
to the plodders that we owe pretty well everything
we wished we had not got. The very
word plod is about the ugliest and the most
nauseating in the English language. Your
plodder may plod and plod and plod, but he
never does anything that is more than middling.
In the arts this is a fact beyond traverse.
The plodding artist is still a student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
at fifty; the plodding writer is a fool to the
end of his life; the plodding actor says,
“My Lord, the carriage waits,” till the workhouse
or the grave claims him for its own.
This being so, why should the plodder be
the only ware in commercial matters? Brilliancy
and imagination are nowadays just as
much wanted in business as in any other department
of life. Tact and a reasonably
decent feeling for your fellow-man are also
wanted. Your Scot, on his own showing,
does not possess these qualities. He even
goes so far as to disdain them and to assure
you that they are not consistent with “force
of character” and “rugged independence.”
The moral is obvious, and I should not be
surprised if English employers of labour have
not already begun to take it to heart. Fire
out the fools! is a shibboleth which comes
ill from a Scotchman, because in the large
result it may easily mean, Fire out the Scotchmen.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SCOT AS A DIPSOMANIAC</span></h2>

<p>Under the inspiring tutelage of the national
bard, Scotland has become one of the
drunkenest nations in the world. Among
the lower classes of the Scotch cities drunkenness
is the preponderating vice. In the rural
districts whiskey is the only beverage that
finds any sort of favour. There is no occasion
of life which does not provoke the average
Scotchman to inhibition. Births, deaths,
and marriages are all celebrated in drink.
On Burns Day, Scotland rushes to the bottle
as one man. The same is true of New Year’s
Day; and year in and year out everybody
“tastes” and “tastes” and “tastes” from
morn to dewy eve. The land simply seethes
in whiskey, and though you take hold of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
wings of the morning you cannot get away
from the odour of it. In twelve hours spent
in Edinburgh I saw more drinking than could
be seen in an English town of the same population
in a couple of days, and I know what
drinking means.</p>

<p>Whiskey to breakfast, whiskey to dinner,
whiskey to supper; whiskey when you meet
a friend, whiskey over all business meetings
whatsoever; whiskey before you go into the
kirk, whiskey when you come out; whiskey
when you are about to take a journey, whiskey
all along the road, whiskey at the journey’s
end; whiskey when you are well,
whiskey if you be sick, whiskey almost as
soon as you are born, whiskey the last thing
before you die—that is Scotland. There is
a cock-and-bull tale to the effect that all the
finest clarets go to Leith and are drunk in
Edinburgh. Practically, there is no really
good claret in all Scotland, unless it be at
the hotels which have been built for the reception
of English and American tourists,
and the Scot to the manner born would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
give you a “thank you” for the best claret
in the world. “Go bring me a pint of wine
and bring it in a silver tassy” was a mere
piece of swagger on the part of the bard.
Wine is not drunk in Scotland; the Scotchman
can get no “forrader” with it, and as for
drinking it out of a silver tassy, there are not
more than three silver tassies in the country.
Whiskey, and that of the crudest and most
shuddering quality is undoubtedly the Scotchman’s
peculiar vanity. The amount that
he can consume without turning a hair is
quite appalling. I have seen a Scotchman
drink three bottles of Glenlivet on a railway
journey from King’s Cross to Edinburgh, and
when he got out at Edinburgh he strutted
doucely to the refreshment bar and demanded
further whiskey. In London, and particularly
in Fleet Street, his feats in this connection
are notorious. In the more central
quarters of London there are a number of
hostelries which are almost wholly devoted to
Scottish requirements in the way of ardent
liquors. Under some Scotch name, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the Scotch Stores, the Clachan, the Highland
Laddie, and so forth, these places flourish
and the proprietors of them wax fat. Here,
any morning in the week, you will find brither
Scots assembled, elbow on counter, indulging
in the whiskey which delights their souls.
All day there is plenty of company, plenty of
Doric, plenty of discussion on politics and the
questions of the hour, but more than all, a
steady flow of whiskey. And by eleven <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>
or thereabouts the company begins to exhibit
a tendency to song. And at closing
time it staggers forth singing <cite>Scots Wha Hae</cite>
and <cite>My Ain Kind Dearie O</cite> in various pathetic
keys. <cite>Scots Wha Hae</cite> is a poor song to
sing in the circumstances, and as for <cite>My Ain
Kind Dearie O</cite>, she probably fumes at home
and is not in the least kind in her welcoming
of her whiskeyful lord. It is certain that the
number of persons in Fleet Street employed
upon the press either in literary capacities
or as advertisement canvassers or printers is
very considerable, and among the lower
grades of them, the drinking of whiskey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
appears to be considered a part of their duty
to themselves and to mankind at large. At
the same time it is only fair to say that a
drunken Scotchman is not by any means a
common spectacle, the reason being that the
Scot is so inured to the consumption of whiskey
from his youth up, that he can take
almost any quantity without becoming drunk
about the legs. Drink, however, he must
and will have, and both at home and abroad
he makes a point of getting as much of it as
his means will allow. In Scotland it is quite
general for men and women alike to drink
whiskey raw and to take the water afterwards.
This is done at every meal, and if
you call upon a Scotch household at any
hour of the day you will be at once offered a
four-or five-finger dose of the national drink.
To refuse it is to be set down for an evilly-disposed
person. Burns the Almighty approved
of whiskey drinking; with him it was
the symbol of good-fellowship, and he is
quoted to you continually as the justification
of all excesses.</p>

<p class="noindent">is the great retort used by Scotchmen if one
suggests that they have had enough or too
much.</p>

<p>It is to the Scot’s amazing capacity for the
consumption of spirit that one may fairly
attribute some of his minor defects. Dourness,
of which every Scotchman possesses a
fair share, and of which he is invariably more
or less proud, has always struck me as being
in a great measure the outcome of too much
whiskey overnight. It is not till he is properly
exhilarated with drink that a Scot can
unbend himself in the smallest degree. Once
primed, he does his best to prove himself an
excellent and generous fellow by becoming
as uproarious as the host of the tavern in
which he is drinking will allow him to be.
But next morning, when the whiskey is out
of him, he is a very sad and sober man indeed.
Then it is that he passes for “dour.” You talk
with him and get for answers grunts: he cannot
smile; he plods heavily away at whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
labour stands in front of him: he is glum,
rude of tongue and dull of mind, and his brethren
set it down for you to his “Scots dourness.”</p>

<p>His gift of steady drinking also accounts,
in my opinion, for his general mediocrity.
Whiskey may be a fine and healthy drink
for persons who do not take enough of it;
but to be braced up with it by day and to
swim in it by night is calculated to have a
detrimental effect even on the bright intellects
that come out of Scotland. I have not
the smallest desire to suggest that there are
not plenty of hard drinkers whose blood is
more or less purely English, yet somehow
there is no kind of man in the world who
makes the drinking of furious spirit a <i lang="la">cultus</i>
and a boast in the way that the Scotchman
does. To be fou’ or as he would put it, to
have a drappie in his eye, is the Scotchman’s
notion of bigness and freedom and manly independence.
He is a ranter and a roarer in
his cups, and on the whole much more distressing
to meet drunk than sober, which is
saying a great deal.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SCOT AS CRIMINAL</span></h2>

<p>Burns, like every other Scotchman that
has trailed a pen, did not fail to help along
the Scottish advertisement with a suitable
contribution. He wrote <cite>The Cottar’s Saturday
Night</cite>, and thereby did a great thing for
Scotland, setting up a picture of Scottish
home life and piety which the generations
seem to regard as authentic. We have all
been taught to admire the moral excellences
of that cottar, not to mention the moral
excellences of his wife and children:</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">All of which is very fine, and, with much
more to the like effect, has helped the Scotch
peasant into an odour of sanctity which on
the whole does not appear to be quite his
element. Indeed, so far from conducting his
life in the manner suggested by <cite>The Cottar’s
Saturday Night</cite>, the average Scot of the lower
orders appears to base himself on the more
scandalous portion of Burns’s writing.</p>

<p>According to the latest returns, the population
of Scotland is 4,472,000. In the year
1900, which is the latest year for which statistics
are available, a matter of 180,000 persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
were charged with criminal offences in
Scotland. So that out of every twenty-five
Scotchmen in Scotland one is either a convicted
criminal or a person who has been
charged with a criminal offence. From the
official Buff-book dealing with the subject I
take the following:</p>

<p>“The criminal returns for 1900 show an
increase over those for the previous year
under all the important classes into which
crime and offences are grouped, the number
of persons charged has risen to close upon
180,000, and if we compare this with the
last published English tables for the year
1899, we shall find, for equal numbers of population,
Scotland has over three charges for
every two in England.</p>

<p>“Furthermore, imprisonments in Scotland
continue to be proportionately much higher
than in England, and for every three committals
in England there are seven in Scotland.
The increase in criminal offences
during 1900 is distributed under the following
heads”:</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that theft and drunkenness
bear the gree among Scotch crimes,
while the large number of offences against
police acts, by-laws, and regulations tends to
show that the Scot is not a good citizen. The
mere statistics as to crime, however, do not
give one anything like an adequate idea of
the general depravity of the Scotch character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
To understand it properly we must
add to the criminal returns the illegitimacy
returns.</p>

<p>From Dr. Albert Leffingwell’s<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> book on
illegitimacy I take the following passage:</p>

<p>“In 1881 the census of Scotland showed
that there were then living in that portion
of the kingdom 492,454 unmarried women
(that is to say, spinsters and widows) between
the ages of fifteen and forty-five.
During the ten years 1878-87 there were
born in Scotland 105,091 illegitimate children,
or an annual average of twenty-one to
each thousand unmarried females at this
specified age. In England and Wales the
corresponding number of the unmarried
females was 3,046,431, and the number of
illegitimate births during the same period
was 426,184, or fourteen to each thousand of
the possible mothers. In Ireland, the number
of unmarried women at this age was a third
larger than in Scotland, or 731,767. Yet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
each thousand of these were born every year
less than five illegitimate children during a
ten-year period, 1878-87. Here again we
are perplexed with the problem why Scotia
and Hibernia should present such widely different
contrasts. Every year in Scotland
there are <em>five times the proportion</em> of bastards
that see the light in Ireland!”</p>

<p>Dr. Leffingwell’s perplexity is the perplexity
of the scientific person. That Burns
should have anything to do with illegitimacy
of Scotia would probably seem ridiculous to
the scientific mind, but I believe that Burns,
and the spirit of loose living for which he
stands, have been to no little extent responsible
for bringing Scotland to the discreditable
and degrading pass indicated by Dr.
Leffingwell’s figures.</p>

<p>In Ireland the rate of illegitimacy is 4.4,
in Scotland, 21.5 to each thousand unmarried
women. Now, the poet who stands in the
same relation to the Irish people as Burns
does to the Scotch is Thomas Moore. He
has given Ireland quite as considerable a body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
of songs as Burns has given to Scotland. He
is just as essentially Irish as Burns is Scotch;
but compare the tone of the two men. One
of them gives you <cite>The lass who made the bed
to me</cite>, the other, <cite>Rich and rare were the gems
she wore</cite>. In reading Burns you find that
quite two thirds of what he has written is
marred by unpleasant and libidinous suggestion,
but there is not a line of Moore which
would not pass muster in a ladies’ school.
To the rantin’ roarin’ Billies of Scotland the
difference may form material for a sneer, but
in the long run, clearly, the advantage is with
the women of Ireland. If Scotland wishes to
get rid of her drunkenness and to lessen the
crime which arises out of it, and if she wishes
to bring herself into line with the ordinary
standards of decency, she will, I am afraid,
have to put a little less trust in that mighty
performer before the Flesh—Robert Burns.</p>

<h2 id="XIV">XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SCOT BY ADOPTION</span></h2>

<p>I have been told that there are two kinds
of Scotchmen, and that it would be a mistake
to confound them, or to suggest that they
have any characteristics in common. One
kind, and the best kind, I am assured, is the
Highlander. The other—and the more disreputable
kind—is the Scotchman of the
Lowlands. I have met both sorts, and I
have not been able to discover that there is
much to choose between them. For all practical
purposes the blood is identical. It may
at one time have been of two distinct strains,
but these appear to have become in a great
measure fused, and the blend is not beautiful.
I think it was Dr. Cunninghame Graham
who said of a certain Scotch peddler that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
looked like a cross between a low-class Indian
and an ourang-outang that had somehow
got itself baptised. This, no doubt, is a
little severe. But a Scotchman does certainly
make one feel that underneath his
unsatisfactory and obviously imperfect civilisation
the hairy simian sits and grins.
Rouse him, thwart him, disappoint him, rally
him, and suddenly your cross-eyed, sandy-haired,
bandy-legged, but withal sleek,
smug, moralising man suddenly “bleezes,”
and you perceive in him the ten thousand
devils of an ancient and arboreal barbarity.
Whether he be Highlander or Lowlander or
mongrel, as he mostly is, it is just the same.
He is Scotch and compounded for the most
part of savage. Like the converted Kroo-boy,
he may at any time revert into his immemorial
primalism and you can never be
sure of him. Whether he hail from the Isles
or from the Lothians, the Scot is just the
Scot, and there is nothing more to be said for
him.</p>

<p>There is, however, a kind of Scot who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
while not of Scotch blood, has adopted the
manners and habits of Caledonia, and is
rather flattered if you take him for a true-born
Scotchman. This type of creature
usually owes his retrogression to the fact that
he has married a Scotch wife. Of Scotchwomen
as a body, I do not wish to say anything
that will be considered ungallant. If
one passes over their abnormal capacity for
thrift, I suppose they are pretty much the
same as other women. So far as I am aware
I have not met more than a dozen Scotchwomen
in my life. Two of them I have
known intimately, and I have always thanked
my stars that I was not married to either of
them. But to return to our Scotchman by
adoption. Usually, as I say, he is married to
a Scotchwoman. Before you arrive at a
knowledge of this circumstance, you are inclined
to wonder what is the matter with him.
His style and proclivities have induced you
to set him down for a Scotchman, yet you
find that his Doric is bad, that he eats his
porridge with sugar and takes his whiskey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
with soda, and that he was born in Gloucestershire.
Also, he tells you frankly that his
parents were not Scotch, and he adds, with
a look of supreme satisfaction, “but my
wife is.” And straightway he plunges into
tender reminiscences of the days of his courtship,
touches modestly upon the wealth and
importance of his wife’s relations, hints at
the fearful expense to which he was put by
his many journeys North when he went
a-wooing, and gurgles with a sickly smile that
it was worth the trouble, and that he does
not know “what he would do without her.”
All of which is mightily interesting. If you
pursue your investigations further, you will
find that the man is perhaps a little more to
pity than to blame. He has been compelled
to become as Scotch as he knows how, willy-nilly.
At the head of his table sits the
daughter of Scotia—ruddy, chapped, and
sharp of tongue; she looks down on things
English, her husband included; her children
are taught to remember that their grandfather
is a provost and magnificent in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
jute line; she keeps her house in the Scotch
manner, her servants are Scotch, her household
linens are Scotch, her beef is Scotch, and
her whiskey is Scotch; her little boys wear
tartan; tripe is the great dish for supper, and
her husband must eat oatmeal to the verge
of scrofula. Abroad, too, this man must be
as Scotch as the best of them. In his place
of business, Scotchmen <i lang="fr">protégés</i> of his wife’s
relations are the only ware: he loathes them,
and they laugh at him behind his back, but
he has to put up with them. On Saturdays
they instruct him in the mysteries of “gowf”;
on Mondays they tell one another what a
“damned foozler” he is. His holidays are
always spent in the Western Highlands; he
is everlastingly seeing his wife off to Aberdeen;
he banks at the Bank of Scotland; he
smokes the tobacco which has been so ably
pushed into fame by Dr. J. M. Barrie; he
believes that the Glasgow bailies know what
they are about; his money, which has been
scraped together on the Scotch principle, is
doucely put away in Scotch ventures; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
altogether Scotland does very well out of him.
The fact that he is a mean little man does not
worry him. The practice and view of life
which the lady of his affections has forced
upon him is bringing him a due share of this
world’s gear, and in that fact he takes consolation
for his attenuated honesty, his lost
manhood, and his lost nationality. This is
one side of the picture and the brightest.</p>

<p>On the other side it were well for us not to
look too closely. The Englishman who has
been appropriated by a Scotch wife does not
always succeed in profiting by the worldly
wisdom with which his spouse would imbue
him. Then there is trouble. For a Scotchwoman
who cannot report to her kindred in
Scotland that her husband is “getting on”
feels that she has been robbed of the prime
joy of existence. Her contempt for the man
who cannot win and grip siller eats into her
soul, until she has no other sentiment left.
Bit by bit she develops into a scold and
a curtain-lecturer; the man who found her
so fair by the Birks of Aberfeldey becomes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
furtive wanderer from her side, and it all
ends in too much whiskey, recrimination, and
execration. I know an Englishman of parts
who has never earned enough money to be
under the necessity of paying income tax.
He is a man of small stature and limp, and
he has a great fear in his eyes. He is one of
those men who might have done things and
have omitted to do them. The gossip about
him is that he is badly married. Once I saw
his wife. She was a big, raw-boned Scotchwoman,
with a heavy accent on her. It was
New Year’s Eve, and she had evidently been
“tasting.” At sight of me, out of the bigness
of her Scotch hospitality, she proposed
a “nep,” and half filled three glasses from a
stone bottle. Then, with hand on hip, glass
uplifted, and a blaze on her face, she cried:
“Here’s tae us and to hell with the English.”
We drank the toast in something of a silence.
Later, when I was about to leave, my limp
friend would have accompanied me to the
door. But the mistress of his heart would
have none of it. “Ye’ll awa’,” she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
then, “to yer bed; yer friend is no’ that fou
but he can find his ain way oot.” So that
we shook hands and parted on the stair. The
man had had twenty years of it. I understand
him.</p>

<p>The idiot who takes to wearing kilts and
speaking with an accent for the mere sake of
it is scarcely worth notice. But there are
such people even outside Colney Hatch.
What they see in the Scotch to admire to the
point of spuriousness I cannot for the life of
me make out. The garb of old Gaul is, no
doubt, very fetching from the point of view
of the weak-minded, but of its effeminacy
there can be no doubt. Really, it is a costume
for small and pretty boys who are too
young to be breeched. In view of its associations
and of its innate childishness,—not
to say immodesty,—it is a great pity that any
Englishman should go out of his way to wear
it.</p>

<h2 id="XV">XV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE SCOT AND ENGLAND</span></h2>

<p>Although the political relations between
Scotland and England would seem to have
been of the smoothest since the Act of Union,
and in spite of the fact that on the whole the
merging of the two peoples under one Government
has tended hugely to the benefit of
Scotland, it is the Scotch fashion to lament
the Union with groans and to insist that 1707
was a black year for Scotchmen. I believe
that were it not for the circumstance that
Scotland cannot produce capable men even
in the way of agitators we should soon have
at St. Stephen’s a Scotch party which would
be just as troublesome and just as noisy and
truculent as is the Irish party. I believe,
too, that within twelve months’ time as big a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
demand for Home Rule and as much disquiet
and rebellion could be got up in Scotland
as have ever existed in Ireland. Fortunately,
however, the Scotch possess neither
the requisite agitators nor the requisite pluck
to indulge in serious demonstrations against
the Imperial Government. So that they
have to content themselves with futile grumbling
and petty acts of disloyalty. The Scot
has always been more or less of a fine hand
at a treason. Out of Scotland has come the
only treasonable organisation which England
can boast of at the present day. I refer, of
course, to that absurd group of persons who
once a year decorate the statue of Charles I.
at Whitehall with cheap wreaths, and circulate
leaflets which profess to prove that the
reigning monarch in these realms is a usurper,
and that our only true monarch is a
woman by the name of Mary, who lives somewhere
on the Continent. In any country
but England these gentry would be laid by
the heels; though the mere fact that they
are Scotch renders them quite ineffective.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
We can afford to smile at them. All the
same, we must remember that if they could
make trouble they would. Even in the matter
of the King’s Coronation the Scotch have
managed to give us the usual display of
stupid insolence. Writing to his paper in
May last, the Scottish correspondent of the
<cite>Times</cite> said:</p>

<p>“The approaching coronation of the King
and Queen seems to have awakened rather
less enthusiasm in certain quarters than either
the Jubilee or the Diamond Jubilee of her
late Majesty. It would be absurd to make
much of the difference, but it does exist. In
a word, the celebration of the event will be
distinctly more official than the rejoicings
over the two notable epochs of Queen Victoria’s
later life. Two circumstances have
helped to bring this about—the Royal proclamation
of two successive holidays, and
what is known in Scotland as the ‘numeral.’
They are both absolutely sentimental considerations,
but they have had a slight influence.
Trades councils, becoming ‘permeated’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
with Socialism, protest against what they are
pleased to call the ‘mummery’ in London,
and the association of themselves therewith
through local rejoicings, and the idea of losing
two days’ pay in one week is just sufficient
to arouse their resentment, which some
corporations have tried to appease by ignoring
the proclamation, or applying it, on
their own initiative, to one of the days only.
The ‘numeral’ connotes the quasi-patriotic
objection to the assumption of the title of
King Edward VII. by his Majesty. Some
Scotsmen persist in refusing to see that, in
calling himself the Seventh Edward, the
King neither intended to, nor did, insinuate
that he was the seventh of that name who
had reigned over the United Kingdom, and
they declaim in grotesque fashion against
the payment of any kind of homage to the
Crown. Their insignificance is shown by
the snub administered to them recently by
the Convention of Burghs, which is nothing
if it is not truly and characteristically Scottish:
their influence is no less unmistakable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in the resolution of several public bodies to
omit the ‘numeral’ from the inscription on
their coronation medals, and in the untimely
fits of economy that have overcome some
local authorities not as a rule averse to
feasting.”</p>

<p>It is the old tale over again. The Scotch
braggart cry—“unconquered and unconquerable”—is
made to rend the welkin whenever
the opportunity serves. Edward the
Seventh, of course, cannot be Edward the
Seventh of Scotland. It would never do.
Therefore the “numeral” must not appear
on Scotch medals, and the rejoicings are to
be as far as possible of an official character.
The ululation over the loss of two days’ pay
also is eminently Scotch. There is a time
for work and a time for play, says the wise
man; but the whey-faced Scot plays always
with a certain disconsolateness because he
feels that he is losing money all the time.
The fact is, that Scottish life and Scottish
manners are almost entirely dominated by
the more evil traits of the Scotch character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Independence and thrift must be read into
everything the Scotchman does. Poverty-stricken,
starveling pride has been the ruin of
the Scottish people. It has made many of
them sour, disagreeable, greedy, and disloyal;
it has made some of them hypocrites and
crafty rogues; it has narrowed their minds
and stunted their national development; it
has made them a by-word and a mock in all
the countries of the world, and it has brought
them to opprobrium even among Turks and
Chinamen.</p>

<p>The career of the Scotchman in England
has been picturesquely summarised by Dr.
Cunninghame Graham:</p>

<p>“In the blithe times of clans and moss-troopers
[he says], when Jardines rode and
Johnstones raised, when Grahams stole, McGregors
plundered, and Campbells prayed
themselves into fat sinecures, we were your
enemies. In stricken fields you southern
folks used to discomfit us by reason of your
archers and your riders sheathed in steel.
We on the borders had the vantage of you, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
you had cattle for us to steal, houses to burn,
and money and valuables for us to carry off.
We having none, you were not in a state to
push retaliation in an effective way. Later,
we sent an impecunious king to govern you,
and with him went a train of ragged courtiers,
all with authentic pedigrees but light
of purse. From this time date the Sawnies
and the Sandies, the calumnies about our
cuticle, and those which stated that we were
so tender-hearted that we scrupled to deprive
of life the smallest insect which we had
about our clothes. You found our cheekbones
out, saw our red hair, and noted that
we blew our noses without a pocket-handkerchief,
to save undue expense.… So
far so good. But still you pushed discovery
to whiskey, haggis, sneeshin, predestination,
and all the other mysteries both of our cookery
and our faith. The bagpipes burst upon
you (with a skirl), and even Shakespeare set
down things about them which I refrain from
quoting, only because I do not wish to
frighten gentlewomen.… King George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
came in, in pudding time, and all was
changed, and a new race of Scotsmen dawned
on the English view. The ’15 and the ’45
sent out the Highlanders, rough-footed and
with deerskin thongs tied round their heads,
… they marched and conquered and
made England reel, retreated, lost Culloden,
and the mist received them back. But their
brief passage altered your views again, and
you perceived that Scotland was not all
bailie, prayer-monger, merchant, and sanctimonious
cheat.… Then Scott arose
and threw a glamour over Scotland which
was nearly all his own. True, we were poor,
but then our poverty was so romantic, and
we appeared fighting for home and haggis,
for foolish native kings, for hills, for heather,
freedom, and for all those things which Englishmen
enjoy to read about, but which in
actual life they take good care only themselves
shall share. The pale-faced master
and the Highland chief, the ruined gentleman,
the swashbuckler, soldier, faithful servant,
and the rest, he marked and made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
own, but then he looked about to find his
counterfoil, the low comedians without whose
presence every tragedy must halt.</p>

<p>“Then came the Kailyarders, and said that
Scott was Tory, Jacobite, unpatriotic, unpresbyterian,
and they alone could draw the
Scottish type. England believed them, and
their large sale and cheap editions clinched
it, and to-day a Scotchman stands confessed
a sentimental fool, a canting cheat, a grave,
sententious man, dressed in a ‘stan o’ black,’
oppressed with the tremendous difficulties of
the jargon he is bound to speak, and, above
all, weighed down with the responsibilities of
being Scotch.”</p>

<p>As I have already mentioned, Dr. Cunninghame
Graham is a Scot.</p>

<p>The whole truth about the Scotch relation
with England is that the Scot is more than
sensible of the advantage it brings him, but
being by disposition wise as a serpent, he is
afraid that if he did not pretend to deplore
it, it might not last in its present comfortable
unrestrictedness. Of course, this fear is entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
baseless. The Englishman is too easy
hearted to make laws against needy aliens
whether from north of the Tweed or elsewhere.
All the same, the Scot continues to
howl on principle. He will not have our
King, he will not have the “numeral,” to
call him English or even include him under
the term British is an indignity and an outrage.
The Act of Union was a big mistake:
the poor Scot has been trodden down forbye
ever since, and altogether he is sorry that he
is alive. And, for my own part, I am quite
inclined to think that there is much to be
said for the latter sentiment.</p>

<h2 id="XVI">XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WAY OUT</span></h2>

<p>I do not think it is an exaggeration to
describe England as a Scot-ridden country.
To whatever department of activity one
looks one finds therein, working his way up
for all he is worth and by not over-scrupulous
methods, the so-called canny Scot. In
some professions, notably that of journalism,
as I have shown, he has made himself more
or less predominant. In banks, offices, and
manufactories he is to be found as frequently
as not, ruling the roost in the capacity of
manager or overseer; and in the general
atmosphere of Anglo-Saxon business life
there is a persistent feel of him. That he
should come from his own heathery wastes
and starved townlets to a richer land is quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
natural. That he should desire to do his
best for himself and for people of his own
blood is also natural. But that he should
put on airs and forget that, after all, he is
an alien and a person who by good right is
with us only on sufferance, is the mistake he
makes. The power that he has got for himself
has been won largely by combination and
advertisement. The Scotch superstition is
the oyster out of which he lives. That superstition
was never more general than it is
to-day, and the advertisement of Scottish virtues
and Scottish capacities was never in
merrier progress. The time has come, I
think, for Englishmen to make a stand in
the matter. At any rate, the time has come
for the Scotchman to be taught his place.
One would hesitate to suggest that he should
be got rid of entirely, for he has his uses and
his good qualities. As a hewer of wood and
a drawer of water, as a person fitted by temperament
for the exercise of mechanical
functions, he is all very well; but in matters
where intellect and sparkle are required he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
should be left severely alone. To rid the
press of his influence would be an excellent
thing for the press. It cannot be shown that
he is of the least use in journalism, or that
he does things any better, whether as reporter,
sub-editor, or editor, than the average
Englishman. And it can be shown that
he has used his influence on the press for
purposes which, however legitimate they
may appear to him, are not in the public interest.
It is not in the public interest that
every newspaper one picks up should contain
certificates of character for the Scotch;
it is not in the public interest that he should
be continually written down for a person of
especial intellect, probity, shrewdness, humour,
and the rest. His intellect, in point of
fact, is middling; his probity merely average;
his shrewdness questionable, and his
humour neither here nor there. As a subordinate
he is always a very doubtful bargain.
As a person in authority he is just a bully—“a
bad master,” as Dr. Nicoll puts it. Employers
of labour would find it distinctly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
their interest to look into the question and
to find out how far they are being imposed
upon by mere sententiousness and wise looks
with nothing behind them that is of consequence.
It is not too much to say that if
you have a Scotchman in your place of business,
you are, as a rule, all the weaker for it.
If you go thoroughly into him you will find
that his only quality is his capacity for plod;
as against this he has many ugly traits—jealousy,
over-reachingness, and greediness
among them. Rarely, if ever, does he understand
his business, and of initiative and originality
he is, as a rule, devoid. Changes and
advances are not at all in his line. If you
ask him for something new, something out of
the ordinary, he will bring it to you and impress
you (by talk) with the notion that you
are getting what you want; but if you examine
it, you will find that it is not new at
all, and that really it is not what you want.</p>

<p>The Scot, in fact, rarely rises above mediocrity;
he seldom has an inspiration or a
happy thought; he cannot rise to occasions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and while he is most punctual in his attention
to duty and most assiduous and steadfast as
a labourer, his work is never perfectly done,
and too frequently it is scamped and carried
out without regard to finish or excellence.
Of pride or delight in labour the Scotchman
knows nothing. He works in order that he
may get money and secure his own personal
advancement. His loyalty is a question of
pounds, shillings, and pence; he will be loyal
to you just as long as you are paying him more
than he can get elsewhere, and the moment
somebody comes along with a better offer,
there is an end of you so far as he is concerned.</p>

<p>There are not wanting signs that, in spite
of the manner in which it has been hidden
and bolstered up, the Scotchman’s real character
is beginning to be properly understood.
Nobody can say, with any show of truth, that
the Scot is either loved or admired by the
peoples with whom he comes in contact outside
his own country. Indeed, I believe that
throughout England there is a very strong
anti-Scotch feeling. I have found it difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
to meet an Englishman who, if you questioned
him straightly, would not admit that
he has a rooted dislike for Scotchmen. That
dislike the Scotchman has himself aroused.
His bumptiousness and uncouthness, his lack
of manners, his frequent lack of principle, and
his want of decent feeling, have brought and
will continue to bring their own reward. In
this book I feel that I have merely touched
the fringe of the subject. Facts that go to
prove the main contentions I have laid
down abound. I have not been able to use a
tithe of them. Every person of understanding
can give you instance after instance of
the Scotchman’s underbredness, ineptitude,
and disposition to meanness. Furthermore,
Scotchmen themselves are full of such instances.
Indeed, for the material used in
most of the chapters of this work I am indebted
to Scotchmen. From first to last I
have done my best to convict them out of
their own mouths, and if I have failed, the
fault is not the fault of the Scotch.</p>

<p>For the general guidance of young Scotchmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
who wish to succeed in this country and
who do not desire to add further opprobrium
to the Scotch character, I shall offer a few
broad hints, which are worth taking to heart:</p>

<h2 id="XVII">ADVERTISEMENT</h2>

<p>Never apologise before the offence is a
good rule, and in certain circumstances a
still better rule is, do not apologise at all.
I have not the smallest intention of regretting
anything that has been written in the
foregoing chapters. But I am informed by
a Scotchman who has been kind enough to
read them in proof that there is some likelihood
of their being misunderstood. This,
of course, would be a thousand pities. So
that I shall venture on what may be termed,
for the want of a better phrase, an explanation.
When Dr. Johnson was asked to explain
his reasons for disliking the Scotch, his
reply was of the vaguest. Lamb also did
not quite know why he disliked them; and,
on the whole, it is difficult to say flatly why
one cannot get on with the simple child of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Caledonia. As a matter of fact, my own
antipathy always amuses me. Whether it
will amuse the Scotch is another matter. But
for the sake of their own peace of mind I
should like to ask them not to jump to foolish
conclusions about various hard things I
have said. Since the time of Burns, Scotchmen
appear to have yearned for some one
who should show them their faults:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent1">Oh wad some power the giftie gie us</div>
<div class="verse">To see oorsels as ithers see us!</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">is as frequent on their lips as “The best laid
schemes o’ mice and men,” “A man’s a man
for a’ that,” and the rest of them. And, in
this instance, I have simply done my best to
play the rôle of “some power.” To put an
ugly man in front of a mirror is not, perhaps,
to do him the most tender of services, especially
if you comment upon his style of
beauty the while. For all that, I am hoping
that in some small measure I may be doing
great and useful things for the Scotch as a
nation. If they would only be at a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
pains to discover their faults and at a little
more pains to correct them, one could encourage
hopes for Scotland. “Much may be
done with the Scotchman,” said Dr. Johnson,
“if you catch him young,” or words to that
effect. I am afraid that to all Scotchmen
who have passed the age of forty the present
volume will be a wasted lesson. But there
appear to be a very large number of Scots
who have not yet attained the prime of life,
and it is among these that I expect my counsel
to have effect. They really cannot do
themselves the smallest hurt by taking to
heart the warnings and advice which, as a
result of great labour, are here put before
them. Oh, my dear young Scottish friends,
let me implore you to be wise in time. If I
have beaten you with clubs, be assured that
it is as much for your good as for my emolument.
If you have bought this book, you
never spent a few sixpences to better advantage
in your life. If you have borrowed it,
as I expect most of you have, you are forgiven,
providing you will really try to mend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
For all things to which I have set my hand
that may cause you pain I am truly sorry.
Yet, as the chastisers of one’s youth were
wont to say, the punishment hurts me far
more than it hurts you. I know you will
believe me and do your best to love me.
Whether you do or not, I shall ever continue
to take a kindly interest in you and to pray
for your general reform.</p>

relating facts of no consequence, but at all out of the

Scots than any other nation, who are very careful not
to omit the minutest circumstances of time or place;
which kind of discourse, if it were not a little relieved

Franks; then the Normans; and, lastly, the Scots. It

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
